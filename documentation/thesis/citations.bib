abstract = {Humor is one of the most interesting and puzzling aspects of human behavior. Despite the attention it has received in fields such as philosophy, linguistics, and psychology, there have been only few attempts to create computational models for humor recognition or generation. In this article, we bring empirical evidence that computational approaches can be successfully applied to the task of humor recognition. Through experiments performed on very large data sets, we show that automatic classification techniques can be effectively used to distinguish between humorous and non‐humorous texts, with significant improvements observed over a priori known baselines.}

pages="171--186",
abstract="The area under the ROC curve, or the equivalent Gini index, is a widely used measure of performance of supervised classification rules. It has the attractive property that it side-steps the need to specify the costs of the different kinds of misclassification. However, the simple form is only applicable to the case of two classes. We extend the definition to the case of more than two classes by averaging pairwise comparisons. This measure reduces to the standard form in the two class case. We compare its properties with the standard measure of proportion correct and an alternative definition of proportion correct based on pairwise comparison of classes for a simple artificial case and illustrate its application on eight data sets. On the data sets we examined, the measures produced similar, but not identical results, reflecting the different aspects of performance that they were measuring. Like the area under the ROC curve, the measure we propose is useful in those many situations where it is impossible to give costs for the different kinds of misclassification.",

However, we show that this result is entirely accounted for by exploitation of spurious statistical cues in the dataset. We analyze the nature of these cues and demonstrate that a range of models all exploit them. This analysis informs the construction of an adversarial dataset on which all models achieve random accuracy. Our adversarial dataset provides a more robust assessment of argument comprehension and should be adopted as the standard in future work.",

  abstract = {In January 2019, DeepMind revealed AlphaStar to the world-the first
artificial intelligence (AI) system to beat a professional player at the game
of StarCraft II-representing a milestone in the progress of AI. AlphaStar draws
on many areas of AI research, including deep learning, reinforcement learning,
game theory, and evolutionary computation (EC). In this paper we analyze
AlphaStar primarily through the lens of EC, presenting a new look at the system
and relating it to many concepts in the field. We highlight some of its most
interesting aspects-the use of Lamarckian evolution, competitive co-evolution,
and quality diversity. In doing so, we hope to provide a bridge between the
wider EC community and one of the most significant AI systems developed in
recent times.},
