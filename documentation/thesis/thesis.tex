\chapter{Problem Definition}

\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}

The main goal of this diploma thesis is to research whether computers are capable of understanding human humor by learning Gary Larson's cartoons (see Figure \ref{fig:fig1}). This is done by applying several Deep Learning techniques. \\


Previous approaches of computational humor mainly focused on written text \cite{Yang2015HumorRA}\cite{Bamman2015ContextualizedSD}\cite{HumoristBot}, research of humor using deep learning is still in its infancy. With the advent of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (=CNN) in recent years \cite{Druzhkov2016}, images may now be taken into consideration as well and similarly recurrent neural networks have been improving the state-of-the-art in several natural language processing disciplines \cite{reviewRNN}. \\

\textbf {Cartoon Classification:} \quad Convolutional neural networks are mostly applied to real world pictures, because most problems of computer vision are in this domain. The question remains whether they are also capable of analyzing cartoons and if there are ways on how to improve CNNs for this type of images. An experiment of regular image classification will be adapted for Gary Larson's cartoons. The traditional image classification task using the CIFAR-10 data set, where categorizing images into ten classes (cat, dog, airplane, etc.) will be adapted for his cartoons. Classification should range from animal cartoons, culture dish cartoons to harder categories, such as cartoons that contain a depiction of god. The original task is already solved with convolutional neural networks, the question remains if the same is true for Gary Larson's cartoons \cite{dogsvscats}. \\

\textbf {Humor Classification:} \quad Often cartoons by Gary Larson also contain a punchline, which will be extracted using existing optical image recognition solutions. The extracted text has to be considered when trying to understand humor. Here recurrent neural networks (RNN), especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, will be applied \cite{hochreiter}. The main problem of these networks, is that they have the tendency to overfit to the training data \cite[page 4]{reviewRNN}, which is a major challenge to be overcome. \\

Another goal is to evaluate the resulting neural networks. Hidden inside them, there might be some interesting insights about human humor, especially since deep neural networks are inspired by the human brain and function similarly \cite{Cichy2016}. Maybe some neural network layers will have their own dedicated function, or there will be a cow-detection neuron inside the network? These and related questions will be investigated in the present thesis.

\chapter{Expected Results}

The main outcome of this thesis is a machine learning pipeline which is able to classify a cartoon by funniness. This pipeline consists of a pre-processing phase, training phase and testing phase. A similar pipeline for the cartoon classification task will also be developed, but will be adapted to multilabel classification. Classes include different types of animals (cats, dogs, horses, etc.), different settings (culture dish, stone age, outer space, etc.) and more semantically challenging classes (contains god appearance, contains marriage conflict, etc.). \\

Secondly, the model will be evaluated rigorously and the hope is to find some new insights into the neural structure of human humor. For example, if this thesis shows the existence of a neuron which fires if and only if a cow is visible, this could imply, that the human brain also has neurons that function similarly \cite{Cichy2016}. The existence of layers that serve certain functions might also be worth investigating. \\

If the network performs well in the test phase, then this is a very strong indicator, that the deep neural networks are actually able to learn the human humor. This would open many new research possibilities. \\

Another important result is an annotated ground truth, which will be used to train the classifiers. The annotation contains a rating by funniness as well as a cartoon classification (e.g.: animal appearances, theme cartoons, etc.). This ground truth may be applied for future research as well, such as comparing humor between Gary Larson and other authors.

\chapter{Methodology and Approach}
\section {Literature Research}
First the available literature will be researched. The goal is to have a broad understanding and knowledge of state-of-the-art in machine learning, deep neural network architectures, human humor and human perception. \\

\section {Pre-Processing}
In this step the ground truth will be created: A data set of several thousand cartoons exists, but these cartoons need to be pre-processed in such a way that a neural network can be trained on this data set. The punchlines have to be extracted, the pictures need to be normalized and bad examples filtered. Additionally manual labelling of cartoons is necessary. For the humor classification the funniness of a cartoon has to be annotated with a numerical value and for the cartoon classification task a binary n-tuple that describes which type of cartoon is illustrated. \\

\section {Humor Classification}
Given this data set, based on previous classifications, the goal is to predict how funny a previously unseen cartoon is. This is done by training multiple machine learning classifiers. Important to note is the fact, that humor is subjective, so the generated model might only be applicable for individuals. \\

For the visual component of a cartoon, a convolutional neural network will be trained, as they have been applied very successfully in various image classification tasks \cite{dogsvscats}. If and how deep neural networks have to be adapted to work with cartoons will be researched during the thesis. Possibly a generative adversarial approach may be implemented  \cite{gan2}\cite{gan}.  \\

A punchline analysis will be implemented using recurrent neural networks and other natural language processing techniques. Prime candidate are Long Short-Term Memory networks. Here several variations exist with widely different topologies and architectures \cite{lstmvariants}. The goal is to find the best performing network for the given task. Other techniques may be considered as well, such as Gated Recurrent Units \cite{gru}.

Finally both neural networks are merged together using another, possibly more traditional, machine learning classifier. \\

\section {Cartoon Classification}

Similar to the humor classification approach, a deep neural network that classifies cartoons by different categories will be trained. The question remains how to handle cartoons properly using deep neural networks, additionally data augmenting techniques might be implemented to avoid overfitting. \\

Gary Larson has many reoccurring themes, such as different settings (culture dish, stone age, outer space, etc.), reoccurring animals (dogs, cats, horses, etc.) or other phenomena (god appearing, marriage conflict, etc.). This makes training a deep neural network which is able to classify these categories an interesting task. On the quest to the best classifier, different convolutional neural networks will be applied, possibly combined with a generative adversarial architecture \cite{gan2}\cite{gan}.

\section {Evaluation}

During the evaluation, the trained models are applied to the test set (a set of previously unknown data). The humor classification task has one out of many choices per cartoon, hence it is considered a multiclass classification task, on the other hand the cartoon classification task has many out of many choices per cartoon (since a cartoon can contain for example a cat and a dog), hence it is considered a multilabel multiclass classification task. \\

Evaluation will be mostly based on a confusion matrix in order to calculate an average F-score \cite{Powers2008EvaluationFP}. If the classes are not evenly distributed special considerations are necessary. Additionally ROC curves may be also used for evaluation \cite{Hand2001}. 

\chapter{State of the Art}

\section{Related Work}
At the time of writing this proposal there has been little research in the area of computational humor using deep learning. Deep Learning of Audio and Language Features for Humor Prediction \cite{Bertero2016DeepLO} is the only notable paper in this area, which uses deep learning for punchline detection based on dialogue and audio of a US sitcom. This approach ignores the visual component entirely and also does not use Long Short-Term Memory networks.

For image classification various types of convolutional neural networks are state-of-the-art \cite{dogsvscats}. Recurrent Long Short-Term Memory networks are being used very successfully for many natural language processing tasks and other domains, such as speech recognition \cite{reviewRNN}\cite{googlespeech}. In fact recurrent neural networks are so powerful they are even turing complete \cite{seigelmann:computation}.

Previous approaches of computational humor include sarcasm \cite{Bamman2015ContextualizedSD}, joke detection \cite{Yang2015HumorRA} or rule-based humor \cite{HumoristBot}. All of these attempts treated humor as isolated chunks of text, while also ignoring the visual component entirely.

\end{figure}

A neural network generally consists of multiple neurons, layers and connections. Illustrated at Figure \ref{fig:feedforward} is a fully connected feedforward neural network, with one input layer, one output layer and three hidden layers. Training the neural network is usually achieved by applying the gradient descent algorithm \cite{bishop}.

\end{figure}

Based on feedforward neural networks convolutional neural networks emerged. A convolutional neural network is a deep neural network, since it consists of multiple hidden layers, where additionally to fully connected hidden layers there are pooling and convolutional layers \cite{Druzhkov2016}\cite{cnnnontech}. Figure \ref{fig:convolutional} illustrates a high level view of the cartoon classification process by a CNN.

\section{Recurrent Neural Networks}

Recurrent Neural Networks allow neural networks to be applied on sequences, by containing cycles in the topology of the network. Usually a RNN consists of multiple units, such as Long Short-Term Memory units \cite{hochreiter}, Gates recurrent units \cite{gru}, etc. The focus of this thesis will primarily be on LSTM networks, since they are well known and avoid the vanishing gradient problem \cite {vanishinggradient}.

	\caption{Fully Connected Feed Forward Neural Network}
	\label{fig:feedforward}
\end{figure}

Part of the reason why neural networks are so powerful, especially deep neural networks, stems from their flexibility. They can adapt to many different domains very easily. Illustrated at Figure \ref{fig:feedforward} is a simple fully connected feedforward neural network. A neural network generally consists of multiple neurons, layers and connections. \\

The following neural network introduction is based on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop \cite{bishop}. \\ 

A neural network can be seen as a series of functional transformations. Given the input $x_1, ..., x_D$ and $M$ connections the input layer can be described as:
\begin{equation}
a_j = \sum_{i=1}^{D} w_{ji}^{(1)} + w_{j0}^{(1)}
\end{equation}

where $j = 1, ..., M$. $w_{ji}^{(n)}$ is usually referred to as weights and $w_{j0}^{(n)}$ as biases. $a_j$ is called an activation, which is then transformed using a nonlinear, differentiable activation function $h(\cdot)$:
\begin{equation}
z_j = h(a_j)
\end{equation}
where depending on the problem different activation functions are applied, for example $h(x) = tanh(x)$ or $h(x) = \sigma(x)$ where
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x) = \dfrac {1} {1 + e^{-x}}
\end{equation}
for the first hidden layer the following values are linearly combined:
\begin{equation}
a_k = \sum_{i=1}^{M} w_{kj}^{(2)} + w_{k0}^{(2)}
\end{equation}

where $k = 1, ..., K$ is the total number of outputs of the first hidden layer. The same procedure is repeated for all hidden layers. The final result for the output layer is usually obtained by applying a softmax activation function. \\

The neural network is usually trained by applying a gradient descent optimization. For more information regarding this algorithm Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop is recommended \cite{bishop}. 

\subsection{Convolutional Neural Networks}
The following is summarizing several papers \cite{dogsvscats}\cite{Druzhkov2016}\cite{cnnnontech}.

Based on feedforward neural networks convolutional neural networks emerged. A convolutional neural network is a deep neural network, since it consists of multiple hidden layers, where additionally to fully connected hidden layers there are pooling and convolutional layers. \\

Convolutional layers apply a convolution on each pixel. A convolution is a weighted sum between two functions. The first function is the input signal and the second function a filter kernel. Instead of each neuron being connected to all other neurons, they are connected to a relatively small local subset of the neurons in the previous layer, which allows them to recognize certain local patterns (e.g.: edges). Also in contrast to fully connected layers: The kernel is shared among the neurons (Parameter Sharing), since the recognized features should not depend on their position in the input image. \\

Pooling layers are applied after convolutional layers. Their goal is to reduce the complexity of CNNs. Pooling neurons are connected to a local subset of the neurons in the previous layer, but without weights, biases or a kernel. The input is transformed by a function. A typical pooling layer is Max Pooling, where the result is the maximum value of all incoming connections. \\

Fully connected layers are usually the last layers of a CNN, their task is to perform classification based on the extracted features of the previous layers. \\

\subsection{Recurrent Neural Networks}
Recurrent Neural Networks allow neural networks to be applied on sequences, by containing cycles in the topology of the network. Usually a RNN consists of multiple units, such as Long Short-Term Memory units, Gates recurrent units \cite{gru}, etc. The focus of this thesis will primarily be on LSTM networks. \\

Each architecture has different benefits and applicable domains. Even among LSTM networks there is lots of variation. One of the reasons why LSTMs are so powerful compared to other architectures is due to their design, which avoids the vanishing gradient problem \cite {vanishinggradient}.\\

The most simple LSTM unit consists of a memory cell with input and output gates. Inside the LSTM a self-recurrent connection is placed and the vanishing gradients are kept inside by the gates. For a more detailed architecture overview Long Short-Term Memory by Hochreiter Schmidhuber is recommended \cite{hochreiter}. \\

The punchline of a cartoon will be converted into text strings. Humans are able to understand this representation of text quite well, but only after spending many years of learning to read. The neural network itself does not understand the semantic meaning, the encoding is arbitrary. The string "animal" has as much semantic meaning as the string "foobar". Hence training on this encoding is not expected to have good results. \\

To solve this problem Word Embeddings can be computed. These place words into a feature space where similar words are near to each other, while dissimilar words are far from each other. Such an embedding can be calculated using a Skip-Gram model \cite{wordembedding} or pretrained models are available \cite{pennington2014glove}.

\chapter{Evaluation}

This chapter aims to evaluate the performance of the implemented architectures. in
general the results show that this problem is a very hard one, as, according to the
gathered metrics, no trained model can understand the underlying structure and humour. \\

The available data is split into three sub sets:

\begin{itemize}
\item Training Set: 40\%
\item Validation Data: 20\%
\item Test Data: 20\%
\end{itemize}

The two main metrics chosen are mean absolute error (MAE) and accuracy. The MAE
is being used because it does not penalize cases which are near misses as much. If the
model predicts a funniness of 5, while the real funniness is 6 it is not as bad as it would
have predicted a 1.
The experiments were run on a PC running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using PyTorch 1.0 and
Python 3.6. The hardware is a GTX 1070 Max-Q with an Intel Core i7-8750H. For more
information regarding the build set up and necessary environment please refer to the
GitHub Repository
The hyperparameters were chosen based on best practice, trial’n error and previous
experience with deep neural network training. The search space is far too vast to
exhaustively search for the best setting.


\section{Architectures}
Several architectures have been implemented and are evaluated in the following sections.


\subsection{Baseline}

Four baseline strategies have been selected: 

\begin{itemize}

\item Most Frequent Baseline: Picks the most frequent label in the dataset.
\item Average Baseline: Returns the average funniness of the dataset. For the accuracy metric the average is rounded using round to nearest integer.
\item Random Baseline: Returns a random funniness picked uniformly from one to seven.
\item Stratified Baseline: Returns a funniness sampled from the distribution of the
training set.

\end{itemize}

For the mean absolute error metric the average performed best, while for the accuracy
score the most frequent class has the best score.

\subsection{Simple CNN}
The simple CNN architecture overfits very quickly. The accuracy and MAE sores are
very similar to the most frequent baseline, which indicates that the model most likely
learns to return the most frequent class, instead of generalizing the humour.

\subsection{Transfer Learning of Pretrained ResNet18}
Noteworthy about this approach is that also enabling the data augmentation in the
training phase makes this approach better than the baseline. The exact reason is not
obvious, but indicates that the model does not generalize enough for the
training samples which are not augmented.

The data augmented version of this experiment unexpectedly achieved the best results
during testing phase.

\subsection{Transfer Learned Object Detection}

The result of the object detection approach are incomparable to the other results, as it was not implemented far enough to return any labels. Since initial tests for a simplified image classification task, it was not further developed, as the predicted objects for each object were essentially
random.

\subsection{ELMo Pretrained Model}

Based on the pretrained ELMo model this model initially looked the most promising, as it
achieved the highest validation accuracy. Unfortunately this was only due to overfitting,
as during test phase the performance dropped.

One problem of this approach may be, that many insider jokes of Gary Larson's humour are lost.

Most likely a problem of this approach is that many insider jokes are lost, due to the fact
that the pretrained vocabulary of the ELMo model does not contain many of them, so
they can not be used by our model.

\subsection{AutoML Model}
Initially, when testing on the validation set, the TFIDF configuration looked very promising, as it achieved top results with a very simple feature representation. The test set
revealed overfitting. The ELMo feature representation performed worse in both settings.
Since the TFIDF feature representation would not have relied on a pre-trained vocabulary
it would not have suffered by the problem of domain specific words.

For this experiment the library hyperopt-sklearn was used, as it accomplishes state-ofthe-art of AutoML.

\subsection{Two Stage Model}
The Two Stage Models did not achieve significantly improved results, as it was not able
to beat the baseline. The idea of trying to avoid overfitting by splitting the big tasks into
smaller sub networks which only have a binary decision to make did not work as expected.

Combining the visual and textual information also did not work as hoped. The MAE
score is on par with the baseline, while still beating it at the accuracy score - so it is
technically better. The improvement is not strong enough, that to say that it really
understands humour.

One problem identified was the fact, that the images contained much more data and
also much more noise. Do the idea was to use a deep autoencoder, which reduced the
feature size of the images significantly. But against our expectation it did not improve
the results compared to previous attempts.

\subsection{Evaluation Conclusion}

In general the conclusion is that no model really learns to generalize the humour of
Gary Larson. There is no significant improvement compared to the baselines available.
But the ground work has been started and one thing is for certain: Even in the age of
deep learning there are challenges in the field of Artificial Intelligence which need proper
research and are hard.
31.2. Results
The exact causes for this underwhelming performance is not easy to work out. One
obvious explanation could be that the dataset might be too small. But then again, which
dataset is big enough?
One could also argue that the methodology is maybe flawed. Letting a human rate a
cartoon is very subjective and depends on many factors. Maybe an additional experiment
worth exploring would be, after some time passes, to let the same human rate the cartoons
again and check what performance the human would get. If the human is not able to
reproduce similar results, then the entire methodology might be flawed.
