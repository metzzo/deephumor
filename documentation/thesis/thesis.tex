\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Aim} \label{aim}
This diploma thesis aims to research whether computers are capable of understanding humor by learning Gary Larson's cartoons. This was done by training several deep neural networks. Their task was to predict the funniness of a cartoon better than simple baselines. Even though humor is intrinsicly subjective, the available data allowed quantitative comparisons using the chosen metrics (accuracy and mean absolute error). The goal was to find the best neural network architecture for predicting the funniness of a cartoon.

Furthermore, based on Gary Larson's cartoons a new dataset for computational humor was created, which could help further research in this area.

The questions this work tries to answer, are the following:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Which neural network architecture is best suited for predicting the associated funniness of each cartoon?

\item Do the trained models outperform previously defined baselines? These baselines include most frequent funniness, average funniness, uniform random funniness and stratified random funniness.

\item If a model outperforms the baselines, does it generalize and understand humor? The model could instead exploit spurious statistical cues in the dataset similar to Niven et al. \cite{cleverhans}

\item Which feature domain is best suited for predicting the funniness: Is using both visual and text input better than they perform individually?

\end{enumerate}

On a higher level this thesis tries to bring subjectivity considerations into computational humor. Previous work in this field did not model the humor of a single person, but instead focused on what humans collectively consider humorous. The novel dataset and deep learning enable this new perspective.

\section{Motivation}

Based on the recent success of deep learning in fields such as self-driving cars \cite{selfdriving}, speech recognition \cite{speech}, machine translation \cite{nmt}, etc., one could expect similar success in computational humor. Especially natural language processing and image-related tasks have seen significant improvements of the state-of-the-art through deep neural architectures.

Initially the idea of this thesis was, that the trained model might have been able to extract certain patterns of humor. Gary Larson's cartoons can be grouped into several themes. For example stone age, scientist or cats versus dog are common themes he uses. A competent model could distinguish these themes and might find patterns of humor among these subjects. Someone might find stone age themed cartoons funnier than cats versus dogs cartoons. 

Important to note is that preference is very subjective. The model must be trained by data of the same person, because otherwise the personal preference might be lost. If trained successfully it would open a whole set of new research possibilities: The study of humor of people through the lense of deep neural networks. This is especially interesting, since it has been shown that there are key similarities between how deep neural networks work and how the human brain works. \cite{Cichy2016}

For example if such a model were possible, it could possibly allow a more formal comparison of humor between different authors or different people.
The same model might be able to be transferred to the work of other authors. Depending on how well this transfer works, one could argue whether the humor of these authors are similar or not, given the annotator's sense of humor. Also the trained model themselves could contain interesting features. Possibly a functioning model could develop a cat-detecting neuron, which could reveal insights into human humor.

Another key motivation was in the creation of the underlying dataset: This thesis uses a novel dataset, where each cartoon was paired with a funniness annotation of the same person. This allows to quantitatively evaluate the humor of a single person, as the dataset is comparatively large. The scope of the dataset is also unique, as there is no other dataset with similar cartoons available. In future the same dataset could be used for other tasks. A very hard, but very interesting task would be using a generative architecture, such as generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate a funny cartoon image from a punchline. Or vice versa: Generating a funny punchline from a cartoon image. And finally generating completely new funny cartoons with fitting punchlines.\cite{gan2}\cite{gan}

In recent years more and more deep learning techniques have been applied in the field of computational humor. One problem of these approaches is that they do not take the subjectivity of this problem into account. Humor differs from person to person and also changes over time significantly. For example in Chiruzzo et al \cite{chiruzzo2019overview} the corpus was extracted from twitter where each tweet was classified as humorous or not humorous. The ground truth classification was annotated using crowd sourcing. The problem with such datasets is that the funniness is determined by some form of average. Some individuals might find the same text very humorous, while other individuals might find it not humorous at all. The crowd sourcing hides this fact by averaging. Therefore, these datasets and models usually do not learn the humor of a single person, but instead what most people generally find funny (or not funny). This is very important and also reveals interesting insights into humor, but this thesis' motivation is to focus more on the subjectivity of this topic.

This work finally shows that humor is still a hard problem and current deep learning architectures are not yet capable of generalizing humor in the chosen context of this thesis. Further research is still needed, especially since, if successful, it would enable many new research possibilities.


\section{Methodology}

Firstly I performed a detailed literature survey. The goal was to get a grasp of the state-of-the-art of deep learning in the field of computational humor, image classification, natural language processing and humor in general.

Next I did the data acquisition, in which the ground truth was created: A dataset of Gary Larson's cartoons with funniness annotations was created. These cartoons were prepared such that they could be used for training the neural networks effectively. This included cropping, resizing and filtering the cartoons. Extracting the punchlines, as well as annotating the funniness.

I performed the following steps iteratively. This allowed to adapt to the challenges which occured during the course of this research:

\begin{enumerate}

\item I picked an architecture candidate and designed it accordingly. This was based on prior knowledge and previous literature research.
\item Then I implemented and trained the architecture.
\item Afterwards I evaluated the resulting model. Problems were determined and possible solutions analyzed.

\end{enumerate}

At first the focus was on visual-only models. Then the focus shifted towards text-only models. Finally I evaluated several approaches that combine both text- and visual features into a single model. Also the architectures went from simple to more complex per iteration.

Finally I performed a detailed evaluation. The most interesting models were picked and analyzed thoroughly. Goal of this phase was to find answers to the questions listed in section \ref{aim}.

\section{Overview over thesis}
This section gives a short overview over the contents of this thesis.

Chapter 2 (Background) contains the background necessary for this thesis. Topics covered are computational humor, machine learning, artificial intelligence, neural networks, natural language processing, automated machine learning and an overview over related work.

Chapter 3 (Design) covers the iterative design process of this thesis. This process began with the visual component of Gary Larson's cartoons using convolutional neural networks. Next, design shifted towards the development of deep neural networks for punchlines using LSTMs, AutoML, feed forward neural networks and word embeddings. And finally this chapter outlines the combination of both domains in a single architecture.

Chapter 4 (Implementation) focuses on the implementation aspects of the previously described neural network architectures. The reader gets an overview over the technology chosen and I implemented the the architectures.

Chapter 5 (Evaluation) gives the reader an insight into the final results obtained by selected interesting architectures, compared to the baselines. I examine the inner working of the models, outlining their mistakes using confusion matrices and other techniques.

Chapter 6 (Conclusion) finalizes this thesis with lessons learned during the course of the development of this work. 


\chapter{Background}

As this work combines the field of computational humor with deep learning, an understanding of both fields is required. This chapter contains the required background for this thesis. First an overview over artificial intelligence and machine learning is outlined. Section \ref{nlpbackground} lays out techniques of natural language processing. Section \ref{transferlearning} gives an overview over a technique called transfer learning. The next section (\ref{automlbackground}) outlines automated machine learning. Based on the previous sections I summarize the research area of computational humor in section \ref{comphumorbackground}. This chapter ends with related work of traditional computational humor and deep learning based computational humor in section \ref{relatedworkbackground}.

\section{Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence}
The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tries to reproduce (human) intelligence using computers \cite{questforai}. It is yet impossible to develop a truly intelligent computer program, also known as strong AI \cite{strongweakai}. AI researchers typically pick certain narrow subtasks of what is considered to require intelligence. Such a system is also known as weak AI \cite{strongweakai}. These tasks usually entail some utility for other application domains and range from image classification, self driving cars to machine translation.

\subsection{History of Artificial Intelligence}

In the year 1950 Alan Turing proposed the idea of a test which could determine if machines have human-level intelligence. In this test a human chats with a human and a computer. Both try to convince the human that they are a real human being. If the human is not reliably able to tell them apart, then the computer passes the Turing test \cite{turingtest}.

In the 1960s and 70s AI researchers overestimated the possibilities of their systems greatly. For example, Marvin Minsky (a key researcher back then) said in 1970: "In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being." The goal of artificial intelligence initially seemed tractable:
The computational power of computers increased exponentially and new algorithms and methods were developed \cite{mooreslaw}\cite{questforai}. The first chatbot (ELIZA) by Joseph Weizenbaum which showed how communication between humans and machines could be implemented using relatively simple rules seemed promising \cite{weizenbaum1966eliza}.

There were many schools of thoughts, among others: The symbolic-based approach and the connectionism-based approach \cite{machineswhothink}. Symbolic-based systems reached early success, by applying logic reasoning to AI \cite{machineswhothink}. The idea of connectionism was to model AI systems using the human brain as a blueprint \cite{machineswhothink}. In the end of the 60s many AI researchers lost interest in connectionism, as the limitations of the perceptron were revealed \cite{Minsky1969PerceptronsA}. This insight halted the research in this area for many years \cite{questforai}.

The symbolic-based approach initially showed much success in several tasks (for example: theorem proving \cite{aimodern}) but also reached a limit. The general approach was to model reasoning as a form of search \cite{aimodern}: Proceed step-by-step towards the goal and backtrack if the steps lead to a dead end. The problem with this approach is the sheer size of the search space. The combinatorial explosion is intractable and can only be handled by heuristics, which limit the power of the system \cite{aimodern}. The limiting capabilities of perceptrons and the lack of progress in key areas resulted in the first AI winter in which funding was cut to a minimum \cite{crevier}.

Expert systems dominated the 1980s \cite{machineswhothink}. These were systems which were crafted by human experts and entailed their knowledge of the specific domain it tried to model using logical rules \cite{questforai}. One important contribution of expert systems was their usefulness. Even early experiments managed to diagnose infectious blood diseases \cite{questforai}. 

Research in the field of connectionism continued as well. Backpropagation solved issues of previous attempts \cite{questforai}\cite{aimodern}. Training larger neural networks was now tractable. One of the most popular architectures of the time is the Hopfield network which models an associative memory \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}. Still, the expectations were not met and the second AI winter emerged during the late 1980s \cite{machineswhothink}. This time it not only hit the scientific community, but also many AI companies \cite{questforai}.

During the 1990s AI had a slightly negative connotation \cite{avoidai}: AI-based systems were working in the background and many problems were largely solved (for example speech recognition and information retrieval \cite{avoidai}\cite{historyinformationretrieval}). A big milestone of AI research was achieved, when Deep Blue managed to win against the best chess player of the time, Garry Kasparov \cite{questforai}. This was largely due to the increased computational power and clever engineering, instead of some new paradigm \cite{questforai}.

During this period the collaboration with other research fields began \cite{aimodern}. For example, knowledge from mathematics and economics was applied in AI. Especially decision theory and probability theory brought in very important techniques, such as hidden Markov models and Bayesian networks \cite{statisticsinml}\cite{aimodern}.

The next boom in the field of AI was fueled by Deep Learning and the success it had in many problems of artificial intelligence \cite{selfdriving}\cite{nmt}\cite{speech}, beginning with the convolutional neural network AlexNet which was the first approach that reached a top-5 error of 15.3\% on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2012  \cite{alexnet}.

The boom continued in 2016 with AlphaGo winning against one of the best human player of the board game Go \cite{alphagopaper}. Compared to chess Go is a much more difficult game to play for computers, as the combinatorial explosion is much larger and the heuristics available are much weaker in Go compared to chess \cite{alphagopaper}.

The next frontier of artificial intelligence is not clearly established yet, as the progress of deep learning is very fast. For example the team behind AlphaGo applied similar techniques to real time strategy games successfully \cite{arulkumaran2019alphastar}. It seems that especially tasks requiring long time planning or deep understanding of the underlying structure are a problem \cite{atariplaying}. For example this thesis shows that understanding humor is still very challenging.

%The danger of a third AI winter is greater than never. Despite the recent advances, researchers must be wary to not overestimate the power of AI. The question remains, whether current technology allows for strong AI, or if there is some limit we cannot advance using current approaches.

\subsection{Machine Learning}

Machine Learning (ML) is a domain of AI \cite{aimodern}. Machine learning tries to build a model which generalizes as good as possible to previously unseen data by learning automatically from a training dataset \cite{bishop}. Learning means extracting patterns from the dataset by applying a machine learning algorithm \cite{bishop}. Models can be parametric or non-parametric. A parametric model means that the general function is fixed and can only be adjusted by adapting the parameters \cite{aimodern}. For example neural networks are parametric, as gradient descent adjusts the weights and biases for each neuron during training, while the general structure of the neural network is not. In contrast, for a non-parametric model the machine learning algorithm learns the function itself \cite{aimodern}. An example for this type of model would be k-Nearest Neighbor.  Since the focus of this work are neural networks we will discuss parametric models in more detail.

More formally, a model is a function $\boldsymbol{y}(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\theta})$ where $\boldsymbol{X}$ is the training data and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ are the parameters of the model \cite{bishop}. Through some optimization algorithm (for example gradient descent) the model is adjusted such that it generalizes ("learns") the underlying structure \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}. This model should make good predictions for previously unseen samples. Important is the distinction between model parameters ($\boldsymbol{\theta}$) and model hyperparameters \cite{aimodern}. Model hyperparameters are parameters which cannot be estimated from the available data and are typically set by a human heuristically \cite{hyperparameter}. A parameter on the other hand, can be estimated from the data, given the previously set hyperparameters \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}.

The data $\boldsymbol{X}$ is a matrix where each row is a sample and each column a feature. A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed \cite{bishop}. For example when trying to apply a machine learning task on an image one could use the red, green and blue channel values of each pixel as features. Choosing appropriate features is a difficult task and can make or break the performance of the trained model.

Machine learning tries to approximate a function from the selected dataset. Depending on the available information, different strategies must be applied. Typically, the most convenient and preferred mode is supervised machine learning \cite{aimodern}. Supervised means that not only the data $\boldsymbol{X}$ is available, but also the target values $\boldsymbol{t}$. This means that the problem can be relatively easily solved using an optimization algorithm. More formally we try to find a $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ such that $\boldsymbol{y}(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \boldsymbol{t}$. If the $\boldsymbol{t}$ labels are not available, then unsupervised machine learning is typically applied \cite{aimodern}. For example clustering methods allow unsupervised ML. If a mixture of labelled and unlabelled data is available, machine learning practitioners apply semi-supervised machine learning \cite{semisupervised}.

Additionally, there is a distinction between classification and regression tasks \cite{bishop}. If $\boldsymbol{t}$ is a continuous variable, machine learning practitioners call it a regression task and the model is a regressor. Otherwise, if $\boldsymbol{t}$ is categorical and can only take finite  values, then machine learning practitioners call it a classification task and the model is a classifier. An example for a regression task is stockmarket prediction, where the model predicts the price of some stock. An example for a classification task is spam detection. Such a model predicts whether an e-mail is spam or not (binary classification). Often a regression task can be modelled as a classification task by converting the features using discretization and vice versa \cite{discretization}. Instead of predicting the stock market directly, one can instead predict classes and use the average value of each bucket as the predicted stock price. Refer to table \ref{table:conversionregressclass} for an example. The right approach is highly task dependent \cite{aimodern}.

\begin{table}[]

\begin{tabular}{|l||l|l|l|l|}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Example for the conversion between regression and classification tasks }
\label{table:conversionregressclass}
\end{table}

\subsection{Training of Machine Learning models} \label{trainingofml}

The most important property of a model $\boldsymbol{y}$ is the generalization power for unseen data \cite{bishop}. Training a model $\boldsymbol{y}$ which predicts the training data $\boldsymbol{X}$ perfectly is trivial: The machine learning algorithm could always build a lookup table which memorizes a mapping from the training samples to the target labels $\boldsymbol{t}$ \cite{overfitting}. If this happens, it is called \textit{overfitting} \cite{overfitting}.

The \textit{holdout method} facilitates the approximation of the performance of a model $\boldsymbol{y}$ for previously unseen data \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}. There is often some bias towards the original dataset \cite{datasetbias}. The better the dataset characterizes the underlying problem, the better the final model may perform practically \cite{datasetshift}. For example, if one trains a vehicle detection model, but the dataset does not include any images of motorcycles, then the model will perform badly in the real world. Regardless of the method applied, the model would not be able to detect motorcycles - despite the performance metrics possibly indicating otherwise.

The holdout method first splits the data into three distinct subsets: Training, validation and test set \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}. The practitioner incrementally adjusts the hyperparameters and trains on the training set, based on the performance of the model on the validation set \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}. Finally, to gather the true performance the practitioner has to evaluate on the test set \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}. The following algorithm illustrates the holdout method using pseudo code:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Holdout method \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}}\label{holdoutalgo}
Take the dataset $\boldsymbol{X}$ and split randomly into three distinct subsets: Training, validation and test set.

\While {$\neg$some halting criterion} {
Train the model on the train split.

Check performance of the trained model on the validation set.

Manually adjust hyperparameters such that the model generalizes better
}

Check final performance on the test set of the best trained model

\end{algorithm}

This variant is also commonly referred to as the three-way holdout method \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}. The validation/test split is only needed if there are hyperparameters which are being optimized iteratively \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}.
Due to the lack of standardization, sometimes the validation set is actually called the test set and the test set the validation set \cite{patternrecognitionandnn} \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}.

Commonly used halting criteria include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Maximum number of iterations \cite{kerashalting}
\item Plateauing performance: No improvement after a previously defined number of iterations \cite{haltingcriteria}
\item Maximum performance: The model reaches a certain performance threshold \cite{kerashalting}
\item A combination of multiple halting criteria \cite{kerashalting}
\end{itemize}

\if false
A common split ratio for the training/validation and test set is \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 60\%: Training Set
\item 20\%: Validation Set
\item 20\%: Test Set
\end{enumerate}
\fi

If there is no clear separation between the test and training set, we call it a data leakage \cite{doingdatascience}. The actual performance of the trained model $\boldsymbol{y}$ could be potentially much worse for unseen data than the metrics suggest. Selecting the best performing model, instead of the last model is called early stopping or the pocket algorithm.

Another method for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model is called \textit{cross-validation} \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}: This method randomly splits the data into $n$ partitions. Then $n$ models are trained for each partition, where the partition is the test set and the remaining data is the training set. In general cross validation approximates the performance better than the holdout method \cite{aimodern}. However, as many models are trained (depending on $n$) it can be computationally very expensive  \cite{bishop}.

The following pseudo code illustrates cross-validation, which first splits the data in a $\boldsymbol{TRAIN}$ and a $\boldsymbol{TEST}$ set \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}. Then incrementally the $\boldsymbol{TRAIN}$ set is split into $k$ partitions $\boldsymbol{P}$. For each $(\boldsymbol{TRAIN} \setminus \boldsymbol{P}, \boldsymbol{P})$ pair a model is trained and evaluated \cite{bishop}. Based on the overall performance the practitioner adjusts the hyperparameters accordingly. Finally the $\boldsymbol{TEST}$ set evaluation returns the performance on unseen data \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Cross-validation method \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}}\label{holdoutalgo}
Take the dataset $\boldsymbol{X}$ and split randomly into two distinct subsets: Training ($\boldsymbol{TRAIN}$) and test set ($\boldsymbol{TEST}$).

\While {$\neg$some halting criterion} {
Take the train set $\boldsymbol{TRAIN}$ and split into $k$ partitions

\ForEach{partition $\boldsymbol{P}$}{
Train the model on $\boldsymbol{TRAIN} \setminus \boldsymbol{P}$

Calculate performance on $\boldsymbol{P}$
}

Calculate average performance

Manually adjust hyperparameters such that the model generalizes better.
}

Check final performance on the test set $\boldsymbol{TEST}$ of the best trained model

\end{algorithm}

Depending on the machine learning task and applied methodology, there is no distinct test set \cite{holdoutcrossvalidation}. Figure \ref{fig:holdoutvscv} compares the splits of holdout method and cross validation.

\subsection{Evaluation of Machine Learning models}

Measuring the performance of a model $\boldsymbol{y}$ is an important aspect of proper machine learning \cite{performanceevaluation}. Choosing the performance measure is highly task dependent \cite{performanceevaluation}. For this thesis the mean absolute error (MAE) and the accuracy were selected \cite{accuracy}. Other metrics considered were F1 and mean squared error (MSE) \cite{accuracy} \cite{Powers2008EvaluationFP}.

\subsubsection{Mean absolute error and mean squared error}
\begin{equation}
\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n}\textstyle \sum_{i=1}^n \displaystyle\mid \hat{X}_i - X_i \mid
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n}\textstyle \sum_{i=1}^n \displaystyle\left( \hat{X}_i - X_i \right)^2
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
\text{where}~\hat{X}&~\text{is the predicted sample} \\
X&~\text{is the ground truth}
\end{align*}

MAE is interesting because a near miss is less penalized \cite{accuracy}. For example, if a model predicts funniness of 5, while the real funniness is 6, the term $\mid 5 - 6 \mid = 1$. On the other hand if the predicted funniness were a 2, the term $\mid 2 - 6 \mid = 4$. The lower the MAE the better.

MSE works similarly to MAE, but big errors are penalized more \cite{accuracy}. The calculations for the above examples are $\left( 5 - 6 \right)^2 = 1$ and $\left( 2 - 6 \right)^2 = 16$, which is a significant difference. For a very noisy dataset MAE is usually better suited than MSE.

\subsubsection{Accuracy and F1}
\begin{equation}
\text{Accuracy}=\frac{|\text{True Positives}| + |\text{True Negatives}|} {|N|}\\
\end{equation}
\FloatBarrier
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
where & |True Positives| & is the number of correctly classified samples of the positive class \\
 & |True Negatives| & is the number of correctly classified samples of the negative class \\
 & |N| & is the total number of samples
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\FloatBarrier
\if false
\begin{align*}
\text{where}~&|\text{True Positives}|&~\text{is the number of correctly classified samples of the positive class} \\
&|\text{True Negatives}|&~\text{is the number of correctly classified samples of the negative class} \\
&|\text{False Negatives}|&~\text{is the number of incorrectly classified samples of the negative class} \\
&|\text{False Positives}|&~\text{is the number of incorrectly classified samples of the positive class}
\end{align*}
\fi

Accuracy is easy to understand and is commonly applied in classification tasks \cite{accuracy}. The higher the accuracy the better \cite{Powers2008EvaluationFP}. When applied on an imbalanced dataset, the accuracy metric might not sufficiently describe the performance of the model, as it is trivial to increase the accuracy by returning the most frequent class of the dataset \cite{accuracy}. Consider the following example: The task is evaluating a model which predicts whether a patient has cancer or not. The test dataset is highly imbalanced, and contains 99 samples of patients without cancer and 1 sample of a patient with cancer. If the model always predicts that a patient has no cancer, the resulting accuracy is 99\%. 

\pagebreak

F1 scores handles such cases better, by emphasizing false negatives and false positives more \cite{Powers2008EvaluationFP}. It is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall score \cite{Powers2008EvaluationFP}:

\begin{equation}
\text{Precision}=\frac{|\text{True Positives}|} {|\text{True Positives}| + |\text{False Positives}|}\\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\text{Recall}=\frac{|\text{True Positives}|} {|\text{True Positives}| + |\text{False Negatives}|}\\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\text{F1} = 2 * \frac{\text{Precision} * \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\end{equation}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For multi class classification (more than two possible classes) a confusion matrix helps to visualize the predictions of a model \cite{accuracy}. The rows of a confusion matrix are usually predicted classes and the columns the ground truth. A perfect model would show 100\% along the diagonal of the matrix, as there would be no wrong classifications.

A confusion matrix usually reveals common mistakes of a model \cite{accuracy}. For example if a model never predicts a class, it can be easily detected using this visualization. For an example of a confusion matrix please refer to figure \ref{fig:confusionmatrixtransferlearningtest}.

\section{Artificial Neural Networks}

One of the first artificial neural network, was the perceptron \cite{questforai}. It is a binary classifier and uses a linear function to perform classification \cite{Minsky1969PerceptronsA}. \textit{Binary} refers to the fact that a simple perceptron can only distinguish between two states. The learning process starts with a random decision boundary, which is iteratively adapted such that the number of misclassifications is minimized \cite{aimodern}. Due to the linear decision boundary the perceptron is only able to learn decision boundaries that are linearly separable \cite{questforai}. For example, a simple XOR cannot be learned by a basic perceptron. This motivated the introduction of multi layer perceptrons (MLPs), since they are in theory able to approximate any function, given a nonlinear activation function \cite{universalfunction}. An MLP consists of multiple perceptrons grouped in layers and each layer connects with the previous layer \cite{bishop}. MLPs are feed forward neural network \cite{bishop}.

\end{figure}

Part of the reason why artificial neural networks are so powerful, especially deep neural networks, stems from their flexibility \cite{selfdriving}\cite{speech}\cite{nmt}. They can adapt to many different domains very easily. Illustrated at figure \ref{fig:feedforward} is a fully connected feed forward neural network with 3 hidden layers. Neural networks can have many more layers (refer to section \ref{dlbackground}) or even contain loops (section \ref{lstmbackground}).

A neural network generally consists of multiple neurons, layers and connections \cite{aimodern}. The general inspiration for them is the human brain which also consists of similar building blocks \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}.

In the human brain neurons receive their signals through dendrites (connections in neural networks) and are then sent through the axon to other neurons \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}. The signal strength is adjusted (analogous to activation functions in neural networks) such that other neurons in the brain are more stimulated \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}. Note that key parts of the human brain are not simulated in a neural network: During training the weights and biases are adjusted using gradient descent (for more information refer to section \ref{nntrain}) \cite{recentexcitementabotuneuralnetworks}. Nevertheless artificial neural networks (especially convolutional neural networks) produce similar structures also observed in the human brain \cite{Cichy2016}.

\subsection{Basics of artificial neural networks}

From a different perspective, neural networks can also be seen as a series of functional transformations of some input vector into an output vector \cite{colahbackprop}. Given the input $x_1, ..., x_D$ and $M$ connections the input layer can be described as:
\begin{equation}
a_j = \sum_{i=1}^{D} w_{ji}^{(1)}x_i + w_{j0}^{(1)}
\end{equation}

where $j = 1, ..., M$. $w_{ji}^{(n)}$ is usually referred to as weights and $w_{j0}^{(n)}$ as biases \cite{bishop}. $a_j$ is called an activation or sometimes potential, which is then transformed using a nonlinear, differentiable activation function $h(\cdot)$ \cite{bishop}:
\begin{equation}
z_j = h(a_j)
\end{equation}
Depending on the problem different activation functions are applied. Common functions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tanh function \cite{activationfunctions}: zero-centered function between -1 and 1 \cite{activationfunctions}. Suffers from the vanishing gradient problem \cite{activationfunctions}.
\begin{equation}
h(x) = \dfrac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}
\end{equation}
\item Sigmoid Function \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}: "Squashes" the input value between 0 and 1 \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}.
\begin{equation}
h(x) = \dfrac {1} {1 + e^{-x}}
\end{equation}
\item ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}: Very commonly used in deep learning, as it performs very well on a wide range of different tasks \cite{activationfunctions}. Can be calculated very quickly, as it does not contain any division or exponential \cite{activationfunctions}.
\begin{equation}
h(x) = \text{max}(0, x)
\end{equation}
\item SoftMax \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}: Used to transform any vector into a probability distribution \cite{activationfunctions}. This is commonly used for the final layer of classification tasks with multiple classes (multi class classification) \cite{activationfunctions}.
\begin{equation}
h(\boldsymbol{x}) = \dfrac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{k=1}^{M} e^{x_k}}
\end{equation}
\item Logistic Sigmoid \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}: Similar to SoftMax, but used for binary classification \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x) = \dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}


For the first hidden layer of a neural network the following values are linearly combined \cite{bishop}:
\begin{equation}
a_k = \sum_{i=1}^{M} w_{kj}^{(2)}z_j + w_{k0}^{(2)}
\end{equation}

where $k = 1, ..., K$ is the total number of outputs of the first hidden layer. The same procedure is repeated for the remaining hidden layers \cite{bishop}. The final result for classification tasks is usually obtained by applying a softmax activation function of the last layer's output \cite{bishop}.

Combining these transformations together for a relatively simple two layer network results in the following equation:

\begin{equation}
y_k(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{w}) = \sigma\left(\sum_{i=1}^{M} w_{kj}^{(2)}h\left(\sum_{i=1}^{D} w_{ji}^{(1)}x_i + w_{j0}^{(1)}\right) + w_{k0}^{(2)}\right)
\end{equation}

This term can be simplified by assuming that the input vector $x$ has always a constant term with the value $1$ \cite{bishop}, as this removes the additional addition for the bias for each layer.

\begin{equation} \label{forwardcalculation}
y_k(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{w}) = \sigma\left(\sum_{i=1}^{M} w_{kj}^{(2)}h\left(\sum_{i=1}^{D} w_{ji}^{(1)}x_i\right)\right)
\end{equation}

Evaluating \ref{forwardcalculation} is called forward propagation \cite{colahbackprop}.

\subsection{Training of neural networks} \label{nntrain}

For training a loss function $L(\boldsymbol{w})$ is defined, where $\boldsymbol{w}$ are the trained weights \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.

The loss can have many different forms, but in the following we will discuss primarily the cross entropy loss, since it is commonly used for classification tasks \cite{dlvc}.

\begin{equation}
L(\boldsymbol{w}) = -\sum_{n=1}^N \left( t_n\,\text{ln}\, y_n + (1 - t_n)\,\text{ln}(1 - y_n)\right) \text{ where } 
y_n = y(\boldsymbol{x_n}, \boldsymbol{w})
\end{equation}

Often we want to calculate the loss for multiclass classification problems. Here we encode the labels as $K$ mutually exclusive one hot-encoded-classes \cite{dlvc}. One-hot-encoded means that a classification $c \in \{1, ..., K\}$ is represented using a vector of size $K$ where the $c$-th component is set to $1$ and every other component is set to $0$. Suppose we have 3 classes and the classification for a sample is 2, then the one-hot-encoding of this class is $(0, 1, 0)$. We apply the following loss function for multiclass classification:

\begin{equation}
L(\boldsymbol{w}) = -\sum_{n=1}^N \left(\,\sum_{k=1}^K \left(t_{kn}\,\text{ln}\,y_k(\boldsymbol{x_n},\boldsymbol{w})\right)\right) \text{ where } y_k(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{w}) = \text{SoftMax}(\boldsymbol{y}(\boldsymbol{x_k}, \boldsymbol{w}))
\end{equation}

For regression tasks the L1 loss can be used \cite{accuracy}:

\begin{equation}
L(\boldsymbol{w}) = \dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N |x_n - y_n| \text{ where } 
y_n = y(\boldsymbol{x_n}, \boldsymbol{w})
\end{equation}

The goal of training neural network is to minimize the loss of the model \cite{dlvc}:

\begin{equation}
\text{arg min}\quad L(\boldsymbol{w})
\end{equation}

Training takes advantage of the fact that it is a function composition of differentiable functions \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. This allows the use of a technique called gradient descent \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}. The idea is intuitive: Walk along the path with the steepest descent until some halting criterion is met \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}. Because the neural network is differentiable the steepest descent is relatively easily obtained, by taking the negative of the first derivative of the loss function \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. A halting criterion could be one of those described in section \ref{trainingofml}. Algorithm \ref{gradientedescentalgo} illustrates the pseudo code of gradient descent.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Gradient descent pseudo code \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}}\label{gradientedescentalgo}
\While {$\neg$some halting criterion} {
Compute gradient: $\boldsymbol{w}' = \bigtriangledown	L(\boldsymbol{w})$

Update weights: $\boldsymbol{w} := \boldsymbol{w} - \alpha \boldsymbol{w}'$
}

\end{algorithm}

$\alpha > 0$ is a hyperparameter and called the learning rate \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. $\alpha$ is usually set empirically \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. A too high learning rate (for example $\alpha = 1$) means that the loss of the neural network could oscillate  violently, where the loss function often increases significantly \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. The lower $\alpha$ the more likely it is that the gradient descent converges in a local optima \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Figure \ref{fig:gradientdescent} illustrates the process of gradient descent. % Usually in the beginning of training the learning rate should be higher and at the end the learning rate should be lower. This is the reason why it is common to apply learning rate decay during training. This means that the learning rate is gradually reduced during the learning

\subsection{Applying artificial neural networks}

The naive implementation of gradient descent has problems, which can be mitigated by different measures. Usually a technique called momentum is applied \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. A real world analogy would be a ball rolling down a steep hill. Over time, the steeper the gradient, the faster the ball rolls towards the local minimum. This makes the gradient descent algorithm to be less prone for local minima and usually causes faster converging to the desired optimum \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.

Another technique is called minibatching \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}: Here instead of calculating the gradient of the entire dataset $\boldsymbol{X}$, a small subset of $\boldsymbol{X}$ is taken \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. This not only reduces the amount of computation needed, but also makes it such that local minima are less of a problem, as the gradient is slightly different depending on the minibatch \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.

Obtaining the gradient is also a computationally complicated step. The usual forward derivation method commonly learned in high school does not scale well for many parameters \cite{colahbackprop}. Therefore a technique called backpropagation is commonly used \cite{colahbackprop}. For more information, refer to the next section.

In general, overfitting is a problem of neural networks (and other machine learning algorithms) \cite{aimodern}. To counteract this phenomena we can apply a different loss function with \textit{regularization}, synthetically increase the dataset size using \textit{data augmentation} or randomly dropping certain neurons with \textit{dropout layers} \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Note that these techniques are not exclusive and are usually applied in combination \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.

The idea of data augmentation is to synthetically increase the size of the dataset by applying transformations on the original data \cite{dataaugmentation}. No transformation must alter the original label of the sample. Image data usually allows for many different kind of filters and transformations to be applied \cite{dataaugmentation}. Common operations are random crop, random rotation and adding synthetic noise \cite{dataaugmentation}. In general, this technique allows for better generalization of the trained model \cite{dataaugmentation}. For example, a model which is trained on a cats versus dogs image dataset with a rotation transformation applied might distinguish rotated cats and dogs better, compared to a model trained on a dataset without this augmentation. On the other hand the transformations could unnecessarily force a model to generalize \cite{dataaugmentation}: Applying a skew transformation on the cats versus dogs dataset might make the performance even worse than the trained model.

Regularization tries to avoid overfitting by penalizing	high weights of neurons \cite{aimodern}. This avoids certain inputs from dominating the outputs and nudges the network to make use of all inputs \cite{dlvc}. This can easily be achieved by adapting the loss function slightly \cite{bishop}\cite{dlvc}:

\begin{equation}
L_{reg}(\boldsymbol{w}) = \dfrac{\delta}{2}\norm{\boldsymbol{w}}^2 + L(\boldsymbol{w})
\end{equation}

where $\delta$ is called weight decay.

A dropout layers can be used as well \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. The idea is similar to regularization: The network should not overly rely on certain inputs \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. A dropout layer turns off neurons with a certain probability \cite{dlvc}. This forces the network to generalize better \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Often in CNNs dropout layers are placed at the end of the network before the last fully connected layer \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.

Due to the sheer amount of hyperparameter and possible approaches, successfully designing and training of a neural network can be a challenging task \cite{anintroductiontoneuralnetworks}. There are many rules of thumb for many hyperparameters but in the end it is in the hand of the developer to use a good mixture of clever tricks, as well as trial and error to find a good neural network model \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Automated machine learning is also a very promising research field, more information is available in the next section.

The architecture of the neural network also influences how much it tends to overfit: As a rule of thumb, the more neurons a neural network has, the bigger the learning capacity of the neural network and therefore it overfits easier if the dataset is not sufficiently large \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Empirically, deep networks (many layers) have shown to generalize better compared to less deep networks with a similar number of neurons \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.

\subsection{Backpropagation} \label{backprop}

Backpropagation is an alternative way of determining the gradient of a function \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Backpropagation makes training big neural networks tractable for modern computers \cite{bishop}. Due to its useful properties backpropagation has been reinvented independently in several fields \cite{Griewank2012WhoIT}. It is also known as reverse-mode differentiation \cite{colahbackprop}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{graphics/computationgraph.png}
	\caption{A computational graph with derivatives on the edges. \cite{colahbackprop}}
	\label{fig:computationgraph}
\end{figure}


Another view of neural networks is the view of computational graphs \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Neural networks essentially define a graph of simple computations consisting of differentiable operations \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. In a computational graph derivatives are placed on the edges between nodes. Figure \ref{fig:computationgraph} illustrates a computational graph.

Calculating the derivative of $e$ with respect to $b$ in the graph illustrated in figure \ref{fig:computationgraph} can be calculated by summing up over all paths in the computational graph \cite{colahbackprop}:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial e}{\partial b} = 1 * 2 + 1  * 3
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{graphics/computationgraphsimple.png}
	\caption{A simple computational graph \cite{colahbackprop}}
	\label{fig:computationgraphsimple}
\end{figure}

Summing up over all paths quickly explodes combinatorially, as the number of paths may increase exponentially with the size of the graph \cite{colahbackprop}. For example, applying traditional forward-mode differentiation ($\frac{\partial}{\partial X}$) the computational graph illustrated in figure \ref{fig:computationgraphsimple} would result in the following derivative \cite{colahbackprop}:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial Z}{\partial X} = \alpha \delta + \alpha \epsilon + \alpha \zeta + \beta \delta + \beta \epsilon + \beta \zeta + \gamma \delta + \gamma \epsilon + \gamma \zeta
\end{equation}

which could be greatly simplified instead by using backpropagation ($\frac{\partial Z}{\partial X}$) instead:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial Z}{\partial X} = (\alpha + \beta + \gamma)(\delta + \epsilon + \zeta)
\end{equation}

Backpropagation starts at the output node and works towards the root nodes by calculating the derivative of $\frac{\partial Z}{\partial}$ \cite{colahbackprop}. Figure \ref{fig:computationgraphreverse} outlines backpropagation on a computational graph. Additionally this process also returns a derivative with respect to the output of every node in the graph \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. This is a very useful property for training neural networks \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{graphics/computationgraphreverse.png}
	\caption{Backpropagation applied on computation graph \ref{fig:computationgraph} \cite{colahbackprop}}
	\label{fig:computationgraphreverse}
\end{figure}

Backpropagation can be summarized using the pseudo code described in algorithm \ref{backpropalgodesc}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Backpropagation algorithm \cite{dlvc}}
\label{backpropalgodesc}

\ForEach{node n} {

Compute local gradient $l_c = \frac{\partial n}{\partial c}$ for each child $c$

\subsection{Deep Learning} \label{dlbackground}

A neural network with multiple layers, where each layer applies increasingly higher level feature extraction is a deep neural network \cite{deeplearninginneuralnetworks}. The research field is called deep learning \cite{deeplearninginneuralnetworks}. An advantage of deep neural networks is that they scale very well with the size of the dataset and with the amount of computation power available \cite{alexnet}. As the computational resources increase and the size of the datasets as well, the performance of deep learning models increases as well.

The technique of using multiple layers in neural networks has been around for many years \cite{deeplearninginneuralnetworks}. Relatively recently (2012), the field of deep learning has gained a lot of attention, since the introduction of AlexNet \cite{alexnet} as this was one of the first practical deep neural network outperforming more traditional methods \cite{deeplearninginneuralnetworks}. As the basic techniques of deep learning have been around for many years, the exorbitant computational requirements were intractable for many years \cite{deeplearninginneuralnetworks}. Deep learning on a conventional central processing unit is infeasible for large models \cite{deeplearninginneuralnetworks}. Emerging general purpose programming of graphics cards solved this problem: The training of deep neural networks can be very effectively parallelized and graphics cards excel at such tasks compared to CPUs \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Training neural networks requires to compute the gradient of a large function \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. The gradient can be efficiently calculated using backpropagation \cite{aimodern}. %Backpropagation uses the chain rule to reuse interim results, akin to dynamic programming.

Despite backpropagation and large datasets, controlling the number of weights and biases is still an important factor of successful deep learning models \cite{deeplearninginneuralnetworks}. There are many types of layers, which essentially all serve to reduce the number of parameters \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. For example, convolutional layers are especially suited for image related tasks, as they have a relatively small number of parameters, but perform significantly better than a comparable fully connected layer \cite{deeplearninginneuralnetworks}.

A general problem of neural networks and deep neural networks in particular is the lack of interpretability \cite{interpretabledl}. For humans it is very difficult to make founded assertions of what the neural network actually uses for its prediction \cite{interpretabledl2}. Neural networks are essentially black boxes with input on one side of the network and some prediction returned at the other side of the network \cite{interpretabledl}. This is especially a problem of safety critical systems, such as self-driving cars \cite{selfdriving}. In this domain it is critical for humans to know on which basis the system has decided and whether it is sensible. Natural language processing is also prone to such "clever hans" behaviour, where the neural network exploits statistical cues of the underlying data, instead of really understanding the task \cite{cleverhans}. Interpretable deep learning is an active field of research \cite{interpretabledl}.

  	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{graphics/cnn.png}
	\caption{Visual representation of a convolutional neural network}
	\label{fig:cnn}
\end{figure}

Convolutional neural networks were developed based on feed forward neural networks \cite{bishop}. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep neural network \cite{alexnet}. The basic layer types of CNNs are fully connected hidden layers, convolutional layers and max-pooling layers \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Figure \ref{fig:cnn} illustrates an overview over the architecture of a convolutional neural network.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/convolution.png}
	\caption{3x3 convolution with stride=1 and no padding.}
	\label{fig:convolution}
\end{figure}

Convolutional layers apply a convolution on each pixel \cite{bishop}. A convolution is a weighted sum between two functions \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. The first function is the input signal and the second function a filter kernel \cite{bishop}. Instead of each neuron being connected to all other neurons, they are connected to a relatively small local subset of the neurons in the previous layer, which allows the layer to recognize certain local patterns (for example: edges) \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. The kernel is shared among the input neurons (parameter sharing) \cite{bishop}. This has two main advantages: It introduces translation invariance, which means that it does not matter if a feature occurs at the center or near the edges of an image \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Also it reduces the number of learned parameters significantly \cite{bishop}. Additionally to increase the capacity, multiple convolutions are applied per layer \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. This is called the depth of a convolutional layer \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Due to their design, in contrast to fully connected layers, convolutional layers do not require a fixed input size, which means that they can be applied on images of different sizes \cite{dlvc}. The kernel is a quadratic matrix of size $n$ \cite{alexnet}. To avoid the size reduction of standard convolutions, one can set the padding parameter of a convolutional layer \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. This increases the input data synthetically (for example by introducing a border with constant value). There is also a stride, which defines how the filter moves along the input \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. If the stride is fractional ($1/s$), it is also called a deconvolution or transposed convolution \cite{dlvc}. This operation increases the output size \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.

\end{figure}

Pooling layers are applied after convolutional layers \cite{alexnet}. Their goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the data (as well as sometimes translational invariance) \cite{dlvc}. Local pooling layers are connected to a local subset of the neurons in the previous layer \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. The input is transformed by some function \cite{dlvc}. A typical pooling layer is max-pooling, where the result is the maximum value of all incoming connections of the current local subset (for example 2x2) \cite{alexnet}. Figure \ref{fig:maxpooling} illustrates a max-pooling operation. Another common type of pooling is average pooling, which is often combined with global pooling \cite{globalaveragepooling}. Global pooling means, that the entire data is pooled at once. This operation is usually applied at the end of the convolutional part of a CNN \cite{globalaveragepooling}. Pooling does not involve learning weights, as the function applied is fixed before training \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. There are also problems associated with pooling, as it essentially makes the model forget information \cite{resnet}. This is one reason, why many modern convolutional neural network architectures mostly avoid max-pooling \cite{resnet}.

Fully connected layers are usually the last layers of a CNN, their task is to perform classification based on the extracted features of the previous layers \cite{alexnet}. Interestingly the convolutional part of a CNN can be used for feature extraction for different problem domains (see section \ref{transferlearning}) \cite{deeplearninginneuralnetworks}.

	\label{fig:lstm}
\end{figure}

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are suited for sequences of arbitrary length, in contrast to normal fixed length input vectors for conventional feed forward neural networks \cite{hochreiter}. Recurrent neural networks are recurrent in the sense that they contain cycles in the topology of the network  \cite{deeplearninginneuralnetworks}. In theory RNNs should be capable of understanding long-term dependencies \cite{hochreiter}. In practice naive RNNs with simple loops are not suited for longer sequences, because of the vanishing/exploding gradient problem \cite{hochreiter}. To train a recurrent neural network it must be converted into an equivalent feed forward network \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Figure \ref{fig:rnn} shows a visualization of such unrolling. This process converts an RNN for a sequence of length $n$ into a feed forward networks with $n$ layers. During backpropagation we need to calculate the partial derivative of each weight $w$ with respect to the loss function \cite{hochreiter}. This partial derivative gets exponentially smaller with increasing number of layers, which causes the training to slow down significantly or even stop entirely  \cite{hochreiter}.

Replacing the naive approach with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells has shown to be successful for many tasks \cite{nmt}\cite{hochreiter}\cite{deeplearninginneuralnetworks}. As the architecture of LSTMs keep the vanishing gradient locked inside the cell, instead of propagating through the entire network \cite{hochreiter}. LSTM networks are capable of learning long-term dependencies, which makes them very suited for problems in the domain of text and audio \cite{nmt}\cite{googlespeech}. An LSTM cell is unrolled over time similar to an RNN cell, where for a sequence the LSTM cell is transformed into a multi layer feed forward network \cite{colahlstm}. 

There are many different variations of LSTMs, but all share common building blocks  \cite{colahlstm}: Memory cell input \& output, output gate and a forget gate  \cite{colahlstm}. The memory of an LSTM cell enables the network to remember information over time \cite{hochreiter}. We will now examine a specific implementation of an LSTM cell \cite{colahlstm}.

The forget gate $f_t$ removes information from the memory \cite{colahlstm}:
\begin{equation}
f_t = \sigma \left(W_f \cdot \left[ h_{t-1}, x_t \right] + b_f\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
\text{where}~W_f&~\text{are the trained weights for the forget gate} \\
\left[. , . \right]&~\text{is a concatenation of two vectors} \\
h_{t-1}&~\text{is the last LSTMs unit output} \\
x_t&~\text{is the current input} \\
b_f&~\text{is the learned bias for the forget gate}
\end{align*}
The $\sigma$ ensures, that the result is between $0$ and $1$, where $0$ means forget the state and $1$ means keep the state.

The input gate $i_t$ has a similar function to the forget gate, but instead it decides which information of the cell's memory needs to be updated \cite{hochreiter}. Then the LSTM calculates a new memory vector $\widetilde{C_t}$ \cite{colahlstm}:  

\begin{equation}
i_t=\sigma\left(W_i \cdot \left[ h_{t-1}, x_t\right] + b_i \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{C_t} = \text{tanh}\left( W_C \cdot \left[ h_{t-1}, x_t \right] + b_C \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
\text{where}~W_i&~\text{are the trained weights for the input gate} \\
W_C&~\text{are the trained weights for calculating the new memory} \\
b_i&~\text{is the learned bias for the input gate} \\
b_C&~\text{is the learned bias for calculating the new memory} \\
\end{align*}

Next, the forget gate and input gate are combined to calculate the new cell memory $C_t$ \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.

\begin{equation}
C_t=f_t*C_{t-1} + i_t*\widetilde{C_t}
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
\text{where}~C_t~&\text{is the memory for the current LSTM unit} \\
*&~\text{is element-wise multiplication}
\end{align*}


For the output gate $o_t$, we want to calculate the LSTMs output $h_t$, by combining the input and memory \cite{colahlstm}:
\begin{equation}
o_t=\sigma\left(W_o \cdot \left[ h_{t-1}, x_t\right] + b_o \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
h_t = o_t * \text{tanh}\left(C_t\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
\text{where}~W_o&~\text{are the trained weights for the forget gate} \\
b_o&~\text{is the learned bias for the output gate}
\end{align*}

To increase the learning capacity of LSTMs we can apply multiple LSTM cells sequentially, where the output from the first LSTM is the input for the second LSTM, similar to how convolutional layers are stacked together \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Alternatively we can increase the learning capacity by increasing the size of the LSTM's memory $C$ \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Empirically LSTMs have shown to have a tendency to overfit to the training data easily, which makes it even more important to find right hyperparameters \cite{rnnregularization}.

A newer alternative to LSTMs are gated recurrent units (GRUs) \cite{gru}. Empirically GRUs have shown to train faster and are faster during inference, but in general no significant difference regarding performance has been observed \cite{gru}. Even more recently transformer architectures have shown to be also very successful at learning long-term dependencies \cite{transformer}. Transformer architectures lack recurrent connections entirely \cite{transformer}.

\subsection{Autoencoder}\label{autoencodersection}

An autoencoder is a deep neural network which learns a compact representation of data without supervision \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. This is similar to principal component analysis of traditional machine learning \cite{bishop}. Application areas of autoencoders include feature extraction, image processing and anomaly detection \cite{semantichashing}\cite{anomalydetection}\cite{autoencoderimage}\cite{autoencoderfeatureextraction}. An autoencoder consists of two parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Encoder: Performs a dimensionality reduction from high dimensional data to a low dimensional representation \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}
\item Decoder: Tries to reconstruct the original data from the low dimensional representation \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}
\end{itemize}

The intermediate low dimensional representation is also called \textit{code} \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. The intuition being, that this forces the neural network to extract more general features, which the autoencoder uses to reconstruct the original signal. Still, a big problem of autoencoders is their tendency to overfit and learn a trivial identity mapping \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. There are several advanced autoencoder architectures, which try to mitigate this issue by applying some kind of regularization during training \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Denoising autoencoders get corrupted input data and their loss is still measured by how well it reconstructs the uncorrupted data \cite{denoisingautoencoder}. The regularization of sparse autoencoders only activates a certain number of neurons per layer, which causes the network to especially react to unique statistical features of the dataset \cite{sparseautoencoder}.

For example, an autoencoder architecture can be used to reduce the dimensionality of images while still preserving important semantic information \cite{convolutionalautoencoder}. Figure \ref{fig:autoencoder} shows a simple fully connected autoencoder. As CNNs perform very well in the image domain, they are a natural fit for autoencoders for images \cite{alexnet}. The encoders consists of standard convolutional blocks (convolution + max-pooling). While the decoder has to restore the original image, therefore it usually consists of layers performing transposed convolutions \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Transposed convolutions are used for up-sampling from a low resolution input to a high resolution output (refer to section \ref{mlcnn}) \cite{dlvc}.

\section{Natural Language Processing} \label{nlpbackground}

Natural Language Processing (NLP) combines the disciplines of artificial intelligence and linguistics \cite{statisticalnlp}\cite{speechandlanguageprocessing}. NLP researchers try to build computer programs capable of understanding human language \cite{speechandlanguageprocessing}. Common tasks of NLP include part-of-speech tagging, paraphrase identification, machine translation and speech recognition \cite{surveynlp}\cite{nmt}\cite{googlespeech}\cite{speech}\cite{paraphrase}.

Early NLP tried to achieve its goal by building traditional parsers, similar to what compilers do for programming languages \cite{speechandlanguageprocessing}. Unfortunately, these techniques are inadequate for human languages, due to the ambiguity of human language \cite{statisticalnlp}.

Another common approach has been to apply traditional machine learning for NLP \cite{statisticalnlp}. The general approach is to extract certain features of a text corpus and use these features to train a classical machine learning model \cite{svmnlp}. Empirically, the best performing machine learning algorithm for this context are support vector machines \cite{svmnlp}.

Deep learning currently achieves many state-of-the-art results in NLP \cite{nmt}\cite{paraphrase}. An advantage of many text problems, is the abundance of large corpora, partly due to the rise of the internet \cite{bert}. This is an important advantage especially for unsupervised methods, since labelling of large corpora may be very expensive \cite{elmo}\cite{bert}.

For both traditional machine learning and deep learning based natural language processing it is important to extract the right features from the dataset \cite{statisticalnlp}. High level features (sentence length) are usually not sufficient, therefore the sentences must be converted into more useful features \cite{Yang2015HumorRA}.

A trivial approach would be to give each word a unique identification number \cite{deeplearningnlpstanford}. This approach does not grasp important semantic information about the words \cite{deeplearningnlpstanford}. For example, the words \textit{king} and \textit{queen} are more similar than \textit{king} and \textit{house}. If the featurization assigns the ID=2 for \textit{king} and the ID=42 for \textit{queen}, then the machine learning model has no additional information, that these words are similar concepts. Keeping this information is crucial for successful natural language processing \cite{nmt}\cite{elmo}. Vector space models avoid this problem by representing each word in a high dimensional vector space, where a certain similarity measure holds \cite{pennington2014glove}.

There are different methods for applying natural language processing successfully. A great challenge is to entail semantic context into the trained models \cite{statisticalnlp}. Because text is a sequence of words, we can apply recurrent neural networks in this context \cite{reviewRNN}. Especially recurrent neural networks which handle long-term dependencies reach state-of-the-art results in NLP (for more information, refer to section \ref{lstmbackground}) \cite{hochreiter}. Alternatively, a weaker form of context, is achieved by using a technique called $n$-grams \cite{ngrams}. Here we split the sentences into a set of tuples with size $n$, where each tuple contains the word itself and the next $n - 1$ words of the sentence  \cite{ngrams}. The intuition being, that the context of words can be represented by their surrounding words  \cite{ngrams}. For example the 2-grams (also known as bigrams), for the sentence \textit{I like machine learning} would be $\{(\textit{I}, \textit{like}), (\textit{like}, \textit{machine}), (\textit{machine}, \textit{learning})\}$. This method allows applying bag-of-words techniques to also entail context \cite{bagofwordbigramexample}.

Another way we can build a context-aware model is by applying hidden markov models (HMM) \cite{bishop}. This is a statistical approach where we assume that sentences can be described by a markov process with latent (or hidden) variables \cite{bishop}. HMMs are much simpler, compared to RNNs, as HMMs rely on common statistical techniques \cite{statisticalnlp}. Given that the underlying process is actually a markov process, then they perform very well, otherwise other techniques may perform better  \cite{statisticalnlp}.

Often the corpus available does not contain sufficient labelling. In such cases we can apply clustering methods, which search for patterns in the underlying data, without any additional labelling \cite{aimodern}. Gaussian mixture models are a very powerful clustering method, which assumes that the data is a mixture of multiple gaussians \cite{aimodern}. Through an algorithm called \textit{expectation-maximization} we get a set of gaussian distributions, which allows us to get a probability for each sample that it originated from a specific gaussian, effectively a classification for this sample \cite{bishop}.

In the following subsections I will outline several techniques for extracting word embeddings from a sentence. Beginning with TFIDF, a technique which ranks words by the term frequency and inverse document frequency \cite{tfidf}. Then I continue with GloVe, an unsupervised statistical approach \cite{pennington2014glove}. And finally I conclude this section with a state-of-the-art deep learning based word embedding called ELMo \cite{elmo}.

\if false
There is the concept of positive and negative similarity \cite{TUW-233295}. Positive similarity is denoted using the $\otimes$ operator. Negative similarity is denoted using the $\overline{\otimes}$ operator \cite{TUW-233295}. Similarities based on the dot product are positive similarity measures \cite{TUW-233295}. The cosine similarity is a commonly used positive similarity measure \cite{modernir}. While similarities based on distance (for example: euclidean distance) are negative similarity measures \cite{TUW-233295}. CNNs are based on positive similarity: They perform a convolution, which is also a positive similarity measure \cite{alexnet}. Vector spaces have usually several 100 dimensions \cite{bert}. Positive similarity measures perform empirically better on high dimensional spaces compared to negative similarity measures \cite{surprisinghighdimensional}. Vector space models can be seen as word embeddings \cite{elmo}.

\subsection{TFIDF}


TFIDF stands for term frequency inverse document frequency and is a simple, but powerful vector space model \cite{tfidf}. The idea originated in information retrieval, where the goal is to weight words by their importance for a document and for a query \cite{historyinformationretrieval}. The TFIDF consists of two terms multiplied: Term frequency and inverse document frequency. The term frequency (TF) describes the total number of times a word occurs in a document \cite{irsurvey}. The idea here, is that the more often a word occurs in a given document, the more important it is in describing that document \cite{irsurvey}.

The problem with this is that certain words occur almost ever very frequently (stop words) \cite{tfidf}. For example, the word \textit{the} has in almost every text corpus a very high term frequency, but is rarely important in describing the document. This is the reason why the inverse document frequency (IDF) is also considered \cite{tfidf}. This weight describes the importance of a word compared to all other documents \cite{historyinformationretrieval}. For example, a document about the \textit{Enigma machine} would have frequent mentions of the word \textit{Enigma}, therefore the IDF would be relatively high compared to other words. In contrast, the word \textit{the} occurs usually in all documents, therefore the IDF would be very low.

There exist many different formulas which entail this idea \cite{tfidf}. In this thesis the following TFIDF equations were used \cite{tfidf}:

\begin{equation}
\text{idf}(t) = \text{log} \left(\dfrac{n}{\text{df}(t)} \right) + 1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\text{tfidf}(t, D) = \text{tf}(t, D)idf(t)
\end{equation}


where $t$ is some term, $D$ some document, $\text{tf}(t, D)$ the number of occurrences of term $t$ in document $D$ and $\text{df}(t)$ the number of documents containing term $t$.

The advantage of TFIDF is, that is relatively easy to understand and does not need any time consuming training, as it only counts word occurrences \cite{irsurvey}. This makes it feasible to be trained locally, without the need of any pretrained model. The main disadvantage is that TFIDF does not capture the context of the word well. It is a bag-of-word approach which ignores the word order completely \cite{irsurvey}.

\subsection{GloVe}
The basis for training Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) is a word to word matrix which denotes the frequency of words occurring together in the training data \cite{glovepage}. The intuition of this word embedding is that the ratios of word-word co-occurrence may encode the underlying meaning of the words \cite{pennington2014glove}. During training of the model the objective is to learn word vectors such that the dot product equals to the logarithm of the probability of co-occurrence with another word \cite{pennington2014glove}. GloVe is a bag-of-word approach, as it uses a word to word matrix without any information about sequence \cite{pennington2014glove}.

Table \ref{gloveprobability} shows the calculated conditional co-occurrence probabilities for the words \textit{ice} and \textit{steam} given the words \textit{solid}, \textit{gas}, \textit{water} and \textit{fashion}. Expectedly \textit{steam} co-occurs more frequently with \textit{gas}, while \textit{ice} co-occurs more frequently with \textit{solid}. The unrelated word \textit{fashion} co-occurs rarely with both \textit{steam} and \textit{ice}. The ratio of $P(k|ice) / P(k|steam)$ entails some basic semantic meaning: If the ratio is much greater than $1$ than it correlates well with properties specific to \textit{steam}. On the other hand, if it is significantly below $1$ then the word has a high correlation with \textit{gas}.

\begin{table}[]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|llll}
Probability and Ratio & $k=solid$ & $k=gas$ & $k=water$ & $k=fashion$ \\ \hline
$P(k|ice)$ & $1.9 \times 10^{-4}$ & $6.6 \times 10^{-5}$ & $3.0 \times 10^{-3}$ & $1.7 \times 10^{-5}$          \\
$P(k|steam)$ & $2.2 \times 10^{-5}$ & $7.8 \times 10^{-4}$ & $2.2 \times 10^{-3}$ & $1.8 \times 10^{-5}$          \\
$P(k|ice) / P(k|steam)$ & $8.9$ & $8.5 \times 10^{-2}$ & $1.36$ & $0.96$         
\end{tabular}

\subsection{ELMo}
The previously mentioned models have very limited sense of context, especially each word had the same word vector associated regardless of the context \cite{pennington2014glove}\cite{tfidf}. ELMo (Embeddings from Languages Models) assigns word embeddings depending on context \cite{elmo}.

The basis for ELMo is a language model trained on a large corpus of text \cite{elmo}. A language model predicts the next word given a sequence of prior words \cite{statisticalnlp}. For example given the sequence of words \textit{Yesterday I was in New York. I visited the statue of ...}, a good language model could predict that the next word would be \textit{Liberty}.

ELMo models language using a 2-layer bidirectional LSTM with residual connections, which allows training of deep models more efficiently. However the words still must be converted into a vector representation \cite{elmo}. This is achieved by first converting the words into a character embedding and then a convolutional layer with max-pooling is applied \cite{elmo}. The character embedding has the advantage that the model handles words better which are not in the vocabulary \cite{elmo}.

The novel idea of ELMo is not how it is trained, but how the trained language model is applied \cite{elmo}: ELMo calculates the final word embedding for a word by combining the different hidden states of the LSTMs and the output of the convolutional part into a unified vector representation \cite{elmo}. The combination is done by multiplying a weight to each state, which is also learned \cite{elmo}.

\section{Transfer Learning} \label{transferlearning}

Usually, the more complex a given task is, the more labelled data deep learning needs to achieve good results \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. This is not only expensive, but sometimes not possible. For example, Gary Larson has only drawn so many cartoons in his lifetime. Labelling a big dataset is also a big challenge and not always feasible.

Transfer learning tries to solve this problem: Instead of training a completely new model for each problem task, the idea is to reuse models and only slightly adapt them for new tasks \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. The original model is trained for an already existing big dataset and the dataset of the fine tuning can be orders of magnitudes smaller \cite{dlvc}. This tuning in the context of deep neural networks is usually done by freezing the weights of neurons in certain higher layers during training \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Usually lower layers perform more general feature extraction, which can be transferred to other domains more easily \cite{dlvc}.

For example there are already very big datasets for image classification tasks \cite{alexnet}. Training a good performing classifier on these datasets has already been done numerous times \cite{resnet}\cite{alexnet}. Especially CNNs have an architecture well suited for transfer learning: As mentioned in section \ref{mlcnn}, there is the convolutional part and the fully connected part. Usually the convolutional part is acting as a feature extractor and the fully connected part makes the final prediction. Empirically it has been shown that the feature extractor generalizes often very well to new domains. Depending on the similarity of the domains, less training is needed for the new domain. For example, this thesis uses a pretrained ResNet8 model which has very good performance on traditional image classification tasks and applies it on Gary Larson's cartoons \cite{resnet}.

Natural language processing works similarly by transferring word embeddings between different corpora \cite{bert}. Importantly, these word embeddings transfer well for a broad range of tasks and still achieving state-of-the-art performance \cite{elmo}.

\section{AutoML} \label{automlbackground}

In machine learning models have increasingly more hyperparameters \cite{alexnet}\cite{resnet}. Traditionally these have been manually set by the machine learning practitioner, which does not scale very well for many hyperparameters \cite{aimodern}. Trivially grid search or random search can be applied. Grid search samples all possible combinations of hyperparameters \cite{automlsurvey}. Consider the following example: If a machine learning algorithm has four hyperparameters and each hyperparameter has six possible values, then $6^4$ models have to be trained and evaluated. There are two significant problems with this approach: It scales exponentially with the number of hyperparameters and for continuous hyperparameters only a predefined subset of possible values can be tested \cite{randomsearch}. Random search assigns random hyperparameters until some halting criterion is reached \cite{randomsearch}. This technique performs very well for many hyperparameter optimization tasks, as it does not waste time on optimizing irrelevant hyperparameters \cite{randomsearch}. 

Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of finding hyperparameters or even the entire machine learning pipeline automatically, without (or with much less) human intervention using machine learning itself \cite{hyperoptpaper}. An ideal AutoML system could perform the following tasks automatically \cite{automlsurvey}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Data pre-processing
\item Feature engineering
\item Feature selection
\item Algorithm selection
\item Hyperparameter selection
\end{itemize}

In practice completely autonomous AutoML it is not yet possible, as the possible search space is intractable by currently available computer hardware \cite{automlsurvey}. Nevertheless, AutoML still may save time and result in possibly better models, as we can focus on more important questions than hyperparameter tuning \cite{automlsurvey}.

This thesis uses the automated machine learning algorithm implemented in the works of Komer et al. \cite{hyperoptpaper}. Their philosophy is that the selection of the entire machine learning pipeline (including data pre-processing) can be seen as a single large hyperparameter optimization problem \cite{hyperoptpaper}.

Using Hyperopt-sklearn requires the machine learning practitioner to define the following parameters, also known as \textit{hyper} hyperparameters (because they are parameters for training the hyperparameters) \cite{hyperoptpaper}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Objective function: Mapping of a configuration into a scalar value, which the algorithm tries to minimize \cite{hyperoptpaper}
\item Search domain: Random variables whose distribution should match the most likely best configuration \cite{hyperoptpaper}
\item Optimization algorithm: An algorithm which finds the best configuration in the search domain given the objective function \cite{hyperoptpaper}
\end{itemize}

Now that I covered the necessary foundations of machine learning, artificial neural networks, natural language processing, transfer learning and automated machine learning, next I will outline the context in which I applied them.

\section{Computational Humor} \label{comphumorbackground}

According to the Oxford dictionary humor is the "the quality in something that makes it funny or amusing; the ability to laugh at things that are amusing" \cite{humordef}. The exact reasons for why humans developed humor are still under debate. It seems that humor contributes to physical and psychological well-being \cite{humorhealthy}\cite{humorresearch}. Evolutionary psychologists have proposed that humor may have been a result of sexual selection: Women may have preferred men with humor, as it may have been a sign of intelligence, adaptability, and desire to please others \cite{sep-humor}.	

Over the centuries, many theories of humor have been proposed: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Superiority theory: One of the first theories of humor, which proposes that laughter expresses feelings of superiority over other people (or a former self) \cite{humorresearch}. This theory was popular until the 20th century.
\item Relief theory: Another early theory of humor, which proposes that humor can be seen as a valve which releases pressure \cite{humorresearch}. This pressure was initially thought to be some kind of gas or energy, but later it was considered to be some form of \textit{psychic energy} \cite{sep-humor}\cite{humorresearch}.
\item Incongruity theory: This theory proposes that humor is the result of the perception of something incongruous \cite{typologyofhumor}. In particular if the mind observes something which violates its mental model and expectations \cite{typologyofhumor}. This is in line with many of Gary Larson's cartoons: The cartoon sets up some expectation, which is usually in contrast to what the reader would have expected. For example scientists behaving like toddlers in usually serious situations. 

\item A more modern view of humor is seeing it as a form of play \cite{sep-humor}. It has been observed, that many animals learn important skills during play \cite{sep-humor}. Humor seems to serve a similar purpose for human social behaviour \cite{humorplay}. Usually humor shows what should be avoided during communication or in other (social) situations \cite{sep-humor}. Laughing and smiling enables these situations and therefore can be considered as a signal to play \cite{humorplay}. 

\end{itemize}


\textit{Computational humor} combines the field of artificial intelligence with the research of humor \cite{comphumordirections}. As the interface between humans and computers becomes more natural, it is also important that computers can also understand humor \cite{HumoristBot}. The rise of chatbots and virtual assistants shows that humor is still a very difficult task for these applications \cite{HumoristBot}. An important challenge of computational humor is that humor is very subjective: There is no general humor, as every person finds different things funny \cite{humorresearch}. This may be the reason why there is currently no unified computational model of humor. Instead models for certain subtasks of computational humor have been constructed \cite{Yang2015HumorRA}\cite{Bertero2016DeepLO}.

Common tasks of computational humor involve generative or discriminative tasks \cite{HumoristBot}\cite{Yang2015HumorRA}: An example for generative task would be joke generation or pun generation. In these types of tasks the computer has to synthesize a joke or a pun. A discriminative task would be for example joke recognition. In this setting the computer should be able to detect whether some text is a joke or not. Computational humor and language understanding go hand in hand \cite{Yang2015HumorRA}: To really understand a joke, the interpreter (be it human or computer) has to understand the language. Proper language understanding is still an important research topic \cite{elmo}\cite{bert}.

Many early approaches of computational humor have focused on the incongruity theory, where humor is an unexpected difference between the expected and the unexpected \cite{comphumorsummary}. The general idea was to find or produce contradictions between what a human would expect and what has been communicated. These approaches had only limited success, most likely because the underlying language understanding was not sophisticated enough \cite{comphumorsummary}. The computer did not have a proper model of what the human would understand and therefore could not apply the incongruity theory successfully.

Another problem of early computational humor models, was their heavy reliance on ontologies, such as WordNet and VerbNet \cite{comphumorsummary}\cite{wordnet}. These are human crafted databases with concepts and their relationships among each other. A challenge for these databases are the ambiguity of many concepts and also their limited size. For example VerbNet contains only around 4500 verbs, which results in a very limited understanding of the sentences \cite{verbnet}.

\section{Related Work} \label{relatedworkbackground}

In this subsection I outline several works of the field of computational humor related to our work. I start discussing several traditional approaches, which do not use deep learning. Then I will continue with deep learning based works.


\subsection{Computational Humor using Traditional Methods}

In the following sections we will discuss several works in the field of computational humor that rely on traditional machine learning methods.

\subsubsection{Humor Recognition and Humor Anchor Extraction}

Yang et al. formalize humor as a binary classification task between humorous and non-humorous \cite{Yang2015HumorRA}. The authors perform their experiments on two datasets: Pun of the Day and One-liner dataset for positive examples. Samples for the negative class come from various other sources (Yahoo! Answers, New York Times, AP News and Proverb). The negative class samples are filtered, such that the sentences are approximately of the same length and contain the same words as the positive class.

Additionally their work also performs humor anchor extraction. This technique extracts the key words that enable the humor of a sentence. Removing these words would make the sentence not humorous anymore. The paper lists the example of the sentence \textit{I used to be a watchmaker; it is a great job and I made my own hours} with a sensible selection of anchors \textit{watchmaker}, \textit{made} and \textit{hours}.

The authors extract several features from the input sentences that describe some aspect of humor.

\begin{itemize}
\item Incongruity structure: disconnection (maximum meaning distance of word pairs) and repetition (minimum meaning distance of word pairs)
\item Ambiguity theory: sense combination (the higher the more possible interpretations a sentence has), sense farmost (largest path similarity of any sense of a word) and sense closest (smallest path similarity of any sense of a word)
\item Interpersonal effect: negative and positive polarity (number of occurrences of negative or positive words) and weak and strong Subjectivity (number of occurrences of all weak or strong subjectivity oriented words)
\item Phonetic style: alliteration (number and maximum length of alliteration chains) and rhyme (number and maximum length of rhyme chains)
\end{itemize}

The work describes the training of a classifier based on these features. Important for the humor anchor extraction is the fact that the features are word order independent and function also on partial sentences. Additionally to these human centric features the best performing model also uses Word2Vec features \cite{word2vec}.

The procedure of determining humor anchors is surprisingly simple. As the feature can be computed on any (partial) sentence the algorithm can freely remove words and still get a reasonable prediction. Also, only certain word types are considered (verbs, nouns, adverbs and adjectives). Algorithm  \ref{humoranchorextraction} describes this idea on a high level.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Humor anchor extraction}\label{humoranchorextraction}

Take only verbs, nouns and adverbs of original sentence

Calculate humor score

\ForEach{$\text{possible anchor subset of sentence}$}{

Calculate humor score of subset

}

Return subset with maximum decrement

\end{algorithm}

From a performance point of view the humor recognition seems to work well. On the Pun of the Day dataset the best model reaches an F1 score of 0.859. The One Liners dataset reaches an F1 score of 0.805.

Humor anchor extraction also performs quite well. The authors perform a quantitative evaluation by comparing 200 random samples that were annotated by three annotators. The strict variant, where the anchors must be exact reached an F1 score of 0.438 and an F1 score of 0.756 for the relaxed version where at least one word had to match on the Pun of the Day dataset. For the One Liners dataset the performance was worse: The strict version reaches an F1 score of 0.288 and an F1 score of 0.616 for the relaxed version.

\subsubsection{Humorist Bot: Bringing Computational Humour in a Chat-Bot System}

Augello et al. implement humor detection and joke generation in the context of a chatbot \cite{HumoristBot}. A chatbot is a software agent able to hold a conversation with a human. Humorist bot is able to generate humorous anecdotes and react to the users humorous messages by adjusting its avatar. A funny message not only affects the answer of the bot, but also changes its avatar to a laughing avatar.

This chatbot uses a rather traditional knowledge base with different answer sets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Set for general conversations
\item Set for humorous sentence generation
\item Set for humorous sentence recognition
\end{itemize}

AIML knowledge base is an XML format which describes a set of possible answers that are matched using pattern matching.

\lstset{language=XML}
\begin{lstlisting}
<category>
    <pattern>How are you?</pattern>
    <template>I am fine. How about you?</template>
</category>
\end{lstlisting}

The authors implemented humor detection by focusing on the following aspects of humor: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Alliteration: based on phonetic transcription
\item Antinomy: based on the antinomy relationships of WordNet 
\item Adult slang: based on a set of words classified as adult slang
\end{itemize}

They do not apply any machine learning techniques, but instead implement handcrafted rules. The authors implemented joke generation by combining several AIML rules.

Evaluation shows that recognition of humor achieves an accuracy of 66\% for 100 randomly selected humorous samples, while a sample of 100 non-humorous sentences contained 19 false-positives. The authors did not perform an evaluation of the joke generation.

\subsection{Computational Humor using Deep Learning}

In the following subsections we will discuss the application of deep learning in the domain of computational humor. 

\subsubsection{Deep Learning of Audio and Language Features for Humor Prediction}

The work of Bertero et al. compares several machine learning techniques for predicting and detecting humor in dialogues \cite{Bertero2016DeepLO}. They use a dialogue dataset from the series \textit{Big Bang Theory}, with annotations of canned laughter. Their goal is to predict these punchlines and where the canned laughter would appear. This work compares several techniques against each other: Convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and conditional random fields. The convolutional neural network use low level representations of words and acoustic frames, while the other two methods use a set of acoustic and language features:

\begin{itemize}
\item Acoustic features: extraction of pitch, line spectral frequencies, intensity, loudness, probability of voicing, $F_0$ envelope, zero-crossing rate, MFCC and speaking rate features
\item Language features: extraction of lexical features (unigrams, bigrams and trigrams appearing at least five times), structural and syntactic features (proportions of verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs, sentence length and average word length), sentiment (average of positive/negative sentiment scores of SentiWordNet), antonyms (presence of verb, noun, adjective and adverbs antonyms from WordNet compared to the previous utterance), speaker turns (speaker identity) and word2vec features \cite{wordnet}\cite{word2vec}
\end{itemize}

Interestingly, their work does not use an LSTM/GRU cell, but instead a simple RNN cell, which often have the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients. \cite{hochreiter} Their RNN architecture applies an embedding layer on the n-gram data and a separate embedding layer on the acoustic and language data for dimensionality reduction. Afterwards they combine both vectors and use this as an input for the RNN cell.

The CNN architecture uses two separate CNN branches for the sentence inputs and for the audio inputs. They use one convolution layer, with a sliding window of five tokens for the sentence input and a sliding window of three frames for the audio input. Both branches have an embedding layer applied that reduces the dimensionality. After the convolutional layer, the authors apply a standard max-pooling layer. Finally their implementation combines both CNN branches and global features into a single feature vector using a softmax layer.

Their corpus is split into a train/validation/test split with 35865 utterances in the train set, 3904 utterances in the validation set and 3903 utterances in the test set. The corpus has in total 42.8\% punchlines.

The CNN shows to be the best performing approach to this task, as it reaches an F1-score of 68.5\%. RNNs performance is relatively low, which may be due to overfitting. Applying an LSTM instead of a simple RNN could potentially learn much more long-term dependencies. Next, I will discuss the authors follow-up work, which uses LSTMs on the same Big Bang Theory dataset.


%Applying a LSTM/GRU cell would be an interesting experiment for future work. The authors themselves remarked, that Long Short-Term Memory cells will be evaluated in future work.

\subsubsection{A long short-term memory framework for predicting humor in dialogues}

Bertero et al. apply LSTMs on the same Big Bang Theory dialogue dataset as in their previous work \cite{Bertero2016DeepLO}\cite{bertero2016long}. Instead of a simple RNN they use a more sophisticated LSTM architecture. Additionally they combine the LSTM with a CNN.

Their feature vector is a combination of the following:
\begin{itemize}

\item One-hot encoded word tokens: Models the likeliness of a word of being humorous
\item Character trigrams: Reduces impact of word stems
\item Word2Vec: Models similarity of words and their semantic meaning \cite{word2vec}

\end{itemize}

First their architecture converts the high dimensional vectors into a lower dimensional representation using an embedding layer. Then they apply a convolutional layer and perform max-pooling afterwards on each feature. Furthermore they combine these features into a single feature vector and add a final sentence encoding layer, which combines the different features. Additionally, similarly to their previous work, the authors also extract high level features (structural features, POS proportions, etc.).

The LSTM in combination with high level features achieves the best performance. The F1-score of this approach is 62.9\%. This seems to be a worse result than the best F1-score of 68.5\% in the previous work, but the key difference is, that the best result of their previous work relied on acoustic features and this LSTM approach is only text-based.

\subsubsection{Humor recognition using deep learning}

The work of Chen et al use several corpora from various sources \cite{chen2018humor}: Pun of the Day, Short Jokes dataset, 16000 One-Liners and PTT Jokes each with a binary annotation, where "1" means the sample is humorous and "0" means it is not humorous. The authors take negative samples from news headlines.

The basis for their architecture is a convolutional neural network. First they convert the words using pre-trained GloVe embeddings. The authors use GloVe trained on Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5 with a vocabulary containing 400,000 words \cite{pennington2014glove}. Then they apply a convolutional layer and try filters of size 3 to 20 for the convolution. Finally they apply a regular max-pooling after the convolutional layer.

In order to improve performance, the authors apply \textit{highway layers}. Highway layers introduce shortcut connections with gate functions, which allows the information to flow more easily through the deeper parts of the network. Additionally they also apply dropout layers.

The authors perform a 10 fold cross validation. A CNN with highway layers and a large filter size of 100 performs the best on 16000 One Liners and Pun of the Day with an F1-score of 90\% for both datasets. Short jokes even reaches 92\% and PTT Jokes 94\%. 

Interesting about this approach is especially that the authors achieved these result without feature selection. The deep learning model can generalize humor in the given context. The chosen experiment could probably even be improved by using new state-of-the-art word embeddings such as ELMo or BERT \cite{elmo}\cite{bert}.

Given the presented papers we have a broad overview over the state-of-the-art in computational humor using deep learning and traditional machine learning. No work tried to model the humor of a single person, and instead opted for a generalized approach. Mostly using crowd annotated datasets or using humorous content which many people find funny (for example the series Big Bang Theory). This shows that the approach this thesis takes, where I try to model the humor of a single person, is novel and could reveal new insights into computational humor.

\chapter{Design} \label{design}

In this chapter the design process of tackling of understanding Gary Larson's cartoons using deep learning is outlined. This process had four main phases: dataset design, visual model design, text model design and combined model design.

\section{Dataset design}

Due to the novel requirements of this approach I created a new dataset from Gary Larson's cartoons. Then I performed an extensive data analysis, which motivated the remaining design process.

\fi

\subsection{Dataset acquisition}
The dataset consists of 2487 cartoons. Each sample consists of a cartoon image, punchline text and a funniness scale from 1 to 7. The funniness scale is ordinal, where 1 means not funny at all and 7 is very hilarious.

Annotation was performed by one of the authors (Robert Fischer) over the course of half a year. The annotation was split in two steps. The first step was preparing the cartoons. In this step the cartoons where cropped and rotated accordingly. The punchline was transcribed from the image into text format, using an OCR, but many manual adjustments had to be applied as well. Additionally cartoons with bad quality, as well as duplicates were also removed.

The second step was to annotate the funniness of the cartoons. There was the problem of humor fatigue: After annotating cartoons for too long, the annotations would get unreliable and could possibly be wrongly classified. This was mitigated by limiting the duration of the annotation sessions. Each annotation session lasted 30 minutes at maximum, but shorter sessions were preferred. 

\subsection{Dataset analysis}

The dataset analysis revealed several interesting facts about the dataset. Figure \ref{fig:labeldistr} shows a bar plot of the label distribution. Unexpectedly the funniness is not uniformly distributed. Over 14\% of the cartoons were deemed to be not funny at all, while only 2\% of cartoons were deemed to be very hilarious.

To verify that the distribution of the annotations has not changed over the course of annotation refer to figure \ref{fig:boxplottime}. Each cartoon has an ascending identification number. Cartoons were  combined into buckets by this number. Finally for each of this bucket a box plot is plotted. This shows no significant change of label distribution over the course of annotation.

	\caption{Box plots of the average funniness over time in the training split.}
	\label{fig:boxplottime}
\end{figure}

A word count analysis showed that there are significant difference in the frequency of certain words. These words seem to contain certain connections to a cartoon theme. For example one of the most frequent words for funniness class 7 is "Thag" which is a common name for cartoons set in the stone age. A similar phenomena could also be observed for word phrases. For example the phrase "thousand more year" is also primarily associated with cartoons set in the stone age. A model could learn this preferences and use it to predict the funniness of a cartoon. For detailed plots please refer to figure \ref{fig:wordocc1}, \ref{fig:wordocc2}, \ref{fig:phraseocc1} and \ref{fig:phraseocc2}.

\section{Visual domain model design}

To reduce the problem space I decided to first try the visual domain of Gary Larson's cartoons. This has the advantage that there are well defined neural network architectures which knowingly perform well on various image related tasks \cite{resnet}\cite{alexnet}.

The goal of this approach was to establish a performance baseline. This models goal was to find out whether a relatively simple convolutional neural network performs well on the target task.

Am important design decision a machine learning practitioner has to make is the input data format and layout. For images the number of input channels and the dimensions of the image is most relevant. Because the cartoons are grayscale the number of channels can be set to 1 without any loss of information. The input size is more difficult to define: If the input size is too large, the neural network has too much information to process and cannot find discriminative patterns. A fitting analogy would be to play the game "Where is Waldo" on an image of the size of a football field. On such image, it would be for humans also very difficult to find the right pattern (in this case Waldo).

Otherwise, if the input size is too small, then crucial information may get lost as well. Resizing an image can be seen as a crude form of dimensionality reduction, as the dimensionality of the data is reduced. Another important consideration is, that 90\% of the images are in lanscape, while the remaining are in portrait orientation. Therefore, predicting the image in lanscape well has priority.

Different configurations for the input size were empirically probed and validated using the validation set. This includes the average size of cartoons, average size of landscape cartoons, several downscaled image sizes. The final best input size was 141x174 px$^2$.

Modelling the output of a neural network is equally crucial. I performed two experiments: One where the network was modelled in a classification setting where the final neurons returned a one hot encoding of the funniness. for classification I used cross entropy loss. Another experiment was modelled as a  regression task, where the final neuron returned the funniness directly. I tested both L1 loss (mean absolute error) and L2 loss (mean squared error) for regression. The regression neural networks did not even approximate the baselines on the validation set, which is the reason why I did not pursue this approach any further.

Another important hyperparameter of CNNs is the number of layers and number of neurons per layer. As the dataset is relatively small in deep learning terms, it was not possible to train too many layers. Conversely, too few layers would mean that the network does not have enough capacity to learn the necessary concepts of humor. The final network consists of two convolutional blocks and one fully connected dense layer at the end. Their depth is set to 100.

Figure \ref{fig:simplecnn} illustrates the architecture of this approach. It consists of two main CNN blocks (with a 3x3 kernel and a depth of 100). The second CNN block also contains a batch normalization layer. The classification is performed by a single fully connected layer.

\subsection{Transfer Learning CNN}

As described in section \ref{transferlearning} transfer learning is a common approach to deal with a small dataset in deep learning. This experiment uses a pretrained ResNet18 model cite{resnet}. ResNet consists of multiple residual blocks, which allows the network to be much deeper compared to a naive CNN and still improve performance. Earlier blocks perform simple feature extraction and later blocks perform high level feature extraction. 

I probed several configurations of this transfer learning approach:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Reuse entire convolutional feature extractor and retrain final classifier
\item Retrain last block of ResNet18 and the final classifier
\item Reuse entire model and add a new final fully connected dense layer
\end{enumerate}

The second approach was the best performing on the validation set. Additionally applying data augmentation was crucial. Applying random horizontal flip, random resize and crop and slight random rotations also improved performance on the validation set.

\subsection{Transfer Learned Object Detection}

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\caption{First row is a shark drawn by Gary Larson. Second row is a real world shark.}
	\label{fig:dataugmentation}
\end{figure}

There were two suspected issues with the previous transfer learning approaches:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The source domain was too distinct from the target domain. The domain of real world images (which ResNet18 was trained on) and cartoons is too distinct for a naive transfer learning approach. I addressed this issue by implementing a novel data augmentation technique.
\item The semantic level of humor may be too high for CNNs to understand. I planned to adress this issue by extracting high-level feature vector based on object detection using CNNs.
\end{enumerate}

The data augmentation (1) illustrated in figure \ref{fig:dataugmentation} works by applying the canny edge detection filter multiple times. The cartoon image is transformed by Canny (using default parameters) into a target domain. The real world image is transformed by applying Canny twice. The first application has a stroke size similar to the average size of Gary Larson strokes. The second application of Canny with the same parameters should bring the real world images into the same target domain.

\begin{table}[]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}

1   & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & ... \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Hypothetical feature vector}
\label{objectdetectionfeaturevector}
\end{table}

To improve the problem of high-level semantics (2) I wanted to train an object detection model based on the CIFAR-100 dataset augmented using the double edge detection data augmentation \cite{cifar100}. This would allow to compute a high-level description of a cartoon based on the objects detected by the object detection algorithm. To validate this approach I first trained a simpler image classification model based on ResNet18. If image classification does not sufficiently work, then object detection will most likely also fail. Such a feature vector is outlined in figure \ref{objectdetectionfeaturevector}.

Unfortunately this approach did not achieve significant results, as there were no consistent classifications. Therefore I did not train the final object detection. If, for example, a person was consistently assigned the same class, then the feature vector could have entailed enough semantic information for cartoon theme-based predictions. The data analysis revealed that there are certain cartoon themes which have higher funniness scores compared to others. 

Another approach I tried was to train an object detection model based on other datasets: The TU Berlin sketch dataset and Googles Quick, draw! dataset.\cite{tuberlin}\cite{quickdraw} Theses approaches did not need the edge detection preprocessing, as they were already in the sketch domain. Still the domains were too distinct, as the image classification performance never reached significant performance.

	\caption{The LSTM architecture with ELMo word embeddings}
	\label{fig:elmolstm}
\end{figure}


First I tried to model the punchlines using an LSTM/GRU neural network architecture. This approach quickly overfitted. I probed several configurations with multiple LSTM/GRU cells sequentially (one or two), an additional trained embedding layer and different memory vector sizes. Figure \ref{fig:elmolstm} shows the final architecture in more detail.

Recurrent neural networks require big datasets, the idea then was to train simpler models. I achieved this by generating a sentence embedding from the sequence of word embeddings. A sentence embedding is a vector representation of a word embedding in a vector space. There are many different ways to obtain such embedding. I chose the simple approach to take the mean of all word embeddings of a punchline. This resulted in a fixed sized vector representation of a punchline, which allowed the use of a regular fully connected neural network.

I chose ELMo as the main context-aware word embedding for this thesis. \cite{elmo} Mainly due to the state-of-the-art results it achieves while still being relatively easy to use in the chosen NLP framework.

Figure \ref{fig:elmowithoutlstm} illustrates the architecture which uses sentence embeddings. It consists of three convolutional blocks with increasing depth and batch normalization. Followed by an average pooling and a dropout to counteract overfitting. Finally the prediction is performed by a fully connected layer. Because this approach performed better on the validation set I chose this approach for a more detailed evaluation in chapter \ref{evaluationchapter}.

Seiten: 1.0

\begin{itemize}
\item Gewählte ELMo Ansätze erklären
\item Zuerst wurde LSTM/GRU probiert. Problem: Overfitting
\item Danach wurde simpler Classifier mit Sentence Embedding angewandt (Sentence Embedding ist ein Vektor für den gesamten Satz statt pro Wort)
\item Visuelle Illustration des gewählten Netzwerks

Das eher bei Design:
\item ELMo vs BERT: Warum wurde ELMo verwendet. Grund: Einfache Verwendung mit gewähltem Framework AllenNLP und performance war vergleichbar bei vielen NLP Tasks
\end{itemize}
\fi

\subsection{AutoML}

Using AutoML my goal was to validate whether an automated approach might find a good model. Because the computer can optimize many more hyperparameters than me, I hypothesized that it might perform better than my manually trained models. For example, it could be, that some other classifier (e.g. SVM) might be better suited for the task at hand.

The selected AutoML library has only limited support for text input feature vectors. So I had to convert the words to fixed length numerical feature vectors. I used TFIDF, ELMo and GloVe. As well as combinations of different word embeddings. This was applied in order to fix the weaknesses of GloVe/ELMo. TFIDF does not have the same problem of GloVe/ELMo of missing words in the vocabulary, because TFIDF was entirely trained on the available dataset. I probed the following feature vectors:

\begin{itemize}

\item TFIDF
\item Mean of ELMo word embeddings
\item Mean of GloVe word embeddings
\item TFIDF + GloVe mean
\item TFIDF + ELMo mean

\end{itemize}

The best performing approach on the validation set was the model trained which only uses the mean of ELMo word embeddings.

\if false
Seiten: 1

\begin{itemize}
\item AutoML Ansatz erklären
\item Wieso angewandt? Vielleicht findet Computer Hyperparameter besser
\item Vielleicht funktioniert zB eine SVM besser für gewählten Task
\item Wie wurde Feature Vektor erstellt? => TFIDF, GloVe, ELMo, TFIDF + GloVe, TFIDF + ELMo
\end{itemize}
\fi

\section{Visual and text domain combined model design}

Finally I combined the findings of the previous approaches in the final two stage model, which combines the visual and the text domain into a unified neural network architecture.

	\caption{The second stage combines the previously trained models and returns a regression.}
	\label{fig:secondstage}
\end{figure}

With the two stage models I tried to solve two issues: The issue of class imbalance of the dataset and the small dataset size. Figure \ref{fig:labeldistr} illustrates this problem. Analysis revealed that previous models learn to predict the most frequent class.

This approach tries to mitigate this problem by applying a cascade of multiple individually trained classifiers and finally combining them in an ensemble model. I trained for each funniness class a binary classifier which detects whether a given sample belongs to its class or not. This \textit{first stage} results in seven independent classifiers. The \textit{second stage} consists of a regressor which predicts the final funniness based on the last hidden layer of each binary classifier.

Figure \ref{fig:firststage} shows an illustration of the first stage. It handles both the visual and text domain: For the cartoons, first the autoencoder is applied, then two convolutional blocks (5x5 and then 3x3 kernel size) with batch normalization and a depth of 8 and 16. Afterwards the input is flattened and reshaped into a vector and further processed using a simple fully connected layer. For the punchline, first two sentence embeddings are calculated (ELMo and GloVe) and combined into a single vector. And finally reduced using a fully connected layer, ReLU function and batch normalization. The resulting feature vectors of both the punchline and cartoon data are combined using again a fully connected layer, ReLU and batch normalization. Now next, since I am training seven independent classifiers for each funniness we need to make a prediction, which returns whether the given sample belongs to the class of the classifier or not. Therefore a final fully connected layer, ReLU and batch normalization returns the binary classification.

For the second stage (see \ref{fig:secondstage}) we need to combine the predictions of each trained model. Additionally the network performs some additional transformations (dropout, fully connected, batch normalization and ReLU) per feature extractor. Afterwards the network combines the results into a single vector and applies again the same sequence of operations twice.

I tested three different configurations of this approach:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Only punchlines: I trained the binary classifiers on the punchline data (average ELMo vector of the punchline).
\item Punchlines and cartoons: This approach uses both the punchlines and the cartoon images.
\item Punchlines and autoencoded cartoons: Same as the previously mentioned approach but before applying the encoder of a deep convolutional autoencoder.

\end{enumerate}

This modular two stage design has the advantage of needing less training data. This is due to the individual neural networks not being very deep. Therefore the gradient does not vanish and the signal propagates through the entire network. Also it allows to combine both the visual and the text domain quite easily, as only the first stage needs to be adjusted accordingly.

To further reduce the impact of class imbalance I applied oversampling. This means that more infrequent classes are samples more frequently, such that for the binary classifier positive classes are sampled as frequent as the negative classes. Also I tried penalizing false positives in the neural network's loss function, but this did not improve the results.

Another important aspect, due to the relatively small dataset size is reducing the number of parameters of the neural network. To achieve this I chose to reduce the size of the cartoon images. Resizing loses crucial semantic information. To solve this problem I trained a deep convolutional autoencoder separately. The expectation was that the encoder results in more semantic meaningful representations of the cartoons. Unfortunately this was not the case. For more information about autoencoders please refer to section \ref{autoencodersection}.

A list of experiments performed but did not make the cut for a more detailed analysis:

\item \textbf{Wasserstein Loss instead of Cross Entropy Loss}: Idea was to penalize near misses less.
\item \textbf{L1 Loss}: Model as a regression task. Model was not even able to approximate the Average Baseline using this approach
\item \textbf{Applying a discrete cosine transformation (DCT)}: Since convolutions are not well suited for line drawings the idea was to apply a DCT beforehand. 
\item \textbf{Advanced Two Stage Model}: Add different binary classifiers in the first stage.
\item \textbf{Loss Weighting of Two Stage Model}: Try different penalties for different kind of errors in the first stage. For example add more penalty for true positives compared to false negatives.

\chapter{Implementation} \label{implementationchapter}

In the following sections I will describe the implementation part of this thesis. Beginning with the technical foundation, which outlines the libraries and frameworks in use, then continuing with the special labelling tool implemented for annotating the dataset and then continuing with the debugging of deep learning models.

\section{Technical Foundation}

\todo{Gewähltes Command Line Interface: Relevante Parameter via CLI steuerbar machen}
\todo{Warum wurde gegen Jupyter Notebooks entschieden? Reproduzierbarkeit und weitere Gründe}
\todo{Referenzen}
\todo{Eventuell mehr auf die Frameworks eingehen}
\todo{AutoML Technical Foundation erwähnen}

For this thesis I applied several frameworks and libraries for deep learning, data handling and other machine learning tasks. Python is one of the most widely used programming languages for deep learning, as most major deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, Tensorflow) are available in Python. In this thesis I chose to use \textit{PyTorch}, which is a very common deep learning framework. For data handling I applied \textit{pandas} and \textit{NumPy} which both allow efficient handling of large datasets in Python. For more general machine learning tasks (e.g. oversampling and error calculation) \textit{sklearn} proved to be very useful. 

For the punchline-based models \textit{AllenNLP} is the best suited framework, as it was based on PyTorch and features easy to use word embeddings (such as ELMo). It also has a very flexible JSON configuration system which makes it easy to try out different hyperparameters without changing the source code.

An important aspect of deep learning is reproducibility. It is generally very difficult to make sure that experiments can be reproduced, due to the non-deterministic nature of minibatching and some optimizations performed by deep learning frameworks. Fortunately PyTorch has a deterministic mode, which disables these optimizations. Minibatching can be deterministic by setting the initial random seed explicitly. Additionally all relevant development milestones are recorded in a source control system, which contains all necessary files to redo this experiment.

\section{Labelling Tool}

Creating a good Gary Larson cartoon dataset with reliable funniness labels was very important to train the ML models successfully. A great challenge was the fact the the entire labelling had to be performed by a single person, as the goal was to model the humor of this person. These requirements meant that a dedicated labelling tool was the best way to ensure the quality of the dataset, and also save much time.

The labelling tool was able to perform the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Filter out cartoons with low quality.
\item Automated cartoon processing and punchline extraction.
\item Manual cartoon processing allowed cropping the images and manual punchline correction, in cases where the automated system failed, which happened on almost all cartoons in some degree.
\item  Labelling the funniness of a cartoon.
\item Cartoon object bounding box annotation allowed to annotate the bounding boxes and classes of objects seen in cartoons.
\item Annotating the theme of a cartoon (this feature was not used).
\item Based on image and punchline data duplicated cartoons were filtered out.
\item Extended search and ordering allowed finding cartoons by punchline and ID.
\end{itemize}

Whether the tool has actually saved time is difficult to say for sure, but considering how helpful the tool was during labelling, it is very likely that it saved considerable time. Assuming that using the tool annotating a single cartoon took 5 minutes on average, with an original 3634 number of cartoons (not filtered) meant that annotating took 302 hours of work. The time spent developing the labelling tool must also be considered. Development of the tool took around 40 hours, therefore the total time spent annotating was around 342 hours. Conversely, assuming that annotating without a special tool would double the amount of time needed on average to prepare a single cartoon, 604 hours of work were to be expected if no labelling tool was used. Additionally the potential for errors would be much greater, as the tasks are very repetitive and could have lead therefore to more errors. Such errors could be due to selecting a wrong cell in the spreadsheet application or losing all data due to the lack of a proper database.

The tool was implemented using Python, the same programming language as the machine learning part uses. The interface was a mixture of command line interface and web interface. Tasks which were only done once (such as filtering duplicates or applying the automated cartoon pre-processing) were triggered using a command line interface. The more repetitive tasks, such as manual preparation of a cartoon or funniness labelling was done in a web interface. For the web interface I chose the Django framework with an SQLite database.

\section{Debugging of models}

Debugging of deep learning models is a particular difficult task, because interpreting neural networks is very difficult generally. Still it was necessary to detect whether the neural network did not train properly or if the problem itself was not tractable for the chosen methodology. It is not possible to fully detect this issue, but there are a few techniques a machine learning practitioner can apply to verify this problem.

The first and easiest technique is to check the network for exploding/vanishing gradients. If either the gradients vanish very near to 0 or explode towards infinity, then it is clear, that something is wrong with the network architecture. For example, the network may be too deep and the signal vanishes. Similarly it is also very important to check the output values of the network. If the network always returns the same prediction, then it might be an issue with the target labels. During development I had such an issue, which was caused by incorrectly loading the labels.

One very useful approach to verify the neural networks was by making the task much simpler. For this debugging technique I replaced the cartoons with images containing the target label. For example, a cartoon with funniness 1 was replaced by an image of the number 1. If the trained model in this setting is not able to properly predict the target labels we know, that the implementation is faulty and not the task too difficult, as we already know that neural networks are capable of detecting digits in images with very high accuracy.

Another problem occured during implementation where the performance was way too good. The accuracy reached over 80\% after just a few epochs, which was very suspicious. After intense debugging I saw that the train/validation/test split was not disjunct and the training data leaked into the validation set.

\item Wie wurde sichergestellt dass Netzwerke funktionierten? 
\item Einerseits indem die Outputs überprüft wurden (kommt NaN raus oder nur 0?)
\item Cartoon Bilder und Text wurde durch Bilder ersetzt die die entsprechende Klasse des ursprünglichen Cartoons enthielten => Sofort sehr gute Werte
\item Problem war auch, dass einmal der Training/Test/Validation Split fehlerhaft war und deswegen anfangs die Werte viel zu gut waren => Sei immer skeptisch deinen Resultaten gegenüber.
\end{itemize}
\fi


\section{Architecture}

Originally I intended that the entire training and evaluation is controlled using a unified command line program. During implementation it became clear that this is not a feasible approach, as the interface for AllenNLP already provided a very powerful command line interface and fitting it to the custom written system would have been error prone and unnecessary.

\chapter{Evaluation} \label{evaluationchapter}

This chapter aims to evaluate the performance of the implemented architectures. In
general the results show that this problem is very hard. Despite the progress in the field of Deep Learning it was not possible to beat the baseline. \\

The cartoon dataset is split into three subsets:

\begin{itemize}
\item Training Set: 1492 samples % (70\%)
\item Validation Data: 746 samples % (20\%)
\item Test Data: 249 samples % (10\%)
\end{itemize}

The experiments were run on a PC running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using PyTorch 1.0 and
Python 3.6. The hardware is a GTX 1070 Max-Q with an Intel Core i7-8750H. For more
information regarding the build set up and necessary environment please refer to the GitHub Repository \cite{deephumorrepo}.

The hyperparameters were chosen based on best practice and previous
experience by the author with deep neural network training. Because there are many hyperparameters an automated search of the hyperparameter space is infeasible with the hardware available to the author.

\section{Architectures}
Several architectures have been implemented and are evaluated in the following sections.


\subsection{Baseline}

Four baseline strategies have been selected: 

\begin{itemize}

\item Most Frequent Baseline: Picks the most frequent label in the dataset.
\item Average Baseline: Returns the average funniness of the dataset. For the accuracy metric the average is rounded using round to nearest integer.
\item Random Baseline: Returns a random funniness picked uniformly from one to seven.
\item Stratified Baseline: Returns a funniness sampled from the distribution of the
training set.

\end{itemize}

For the mean absolute error metric the average performed best, while for the accuracy score the most frequent class has the best score.

\subsection{Simple CNN}
The simple CNN architecture overfits very quickly. The accuracy and MAE scores are very similar to the most frequent baseline, which indicates that the model most likely learns to return the most frequent class.

\subsection{Transfer Learning of Pretrained ResNet18}
Noteworthy about this approach is that also enabling the data augmentation in the testing/validation phase makes this approach better than the baseline. The exact reason is not obvious, but indicates that the model expects the cartoons to be augmented.

The data augmented version of this experiment unexpectedly achieved the best results during testing phase.

Sampling for each class a cartoon and examining the output layer of the trained neural network reveals some interesting insight about how the model works. In general the results show, that the classifier never assigns high confidence into the predictions. No classification assigns a probability higher than 40\%.

When examining the distribution across the different predictions over the different samples it seems that the general distribution does not change significantly. Some deviations are present, for example when comparing the probabilities for funniness 2.

In general it seems that the model often ignores the input data and instead learns the label distribution. The similarities between the predictions and the histogram of funniness occurrences are very high. Compare figure \ref{fig:figdistr1} and figure \ref{fig:figdistr2} with figure \ref{fig:labeldistr}.

One can clearly see that for both the validation and test split the model learned to approximate the label distribution, instead of learning to generalize the underlying structure. The three most frequent funniness classes (1, 4 and 2) are the only ones the model predicts and are therefore by chance correct. Other classes are not predicted at all by the classifier. This motivated the design of the two stage model, where specific models are trained for each funniness class.


\subsection{Transfer Learned Object Detection}

The result of the object detection approach are incomparable to the other results, as it was not implemented far enough to return any labels. It was not further developed, as the predicted objects for each object were essentially random.

\subsection{ELMo Pretrained Model}

Based on the pretrained ELMo model this model initially looked the most promising, as it
achieved the highest validation accuracy. Unfortunately this was only due to overfitting,
as during test phase the performance dropped.

Most likely a problem of this approach is that many insider jokes are lost, due to the fact
that the pretrained vocabulary of the ELMo model does not contain many of them, so
they can not be used by our model. For example the word "Thag" which is one of the most frequent terms for cartoons with funniness 7 is not in the ELMo vocabulary and therefore ignored.

\subsection{AutoML Model}
Initially, when testing on the validation set, the TFIDF configuration looked very promising, as it achieved top results with a very simple feature representation. The test set
revealed overfitting. The ELMo feature representation performed worse in both settings.
Since the TFIDF feature representation would not have relied on a pre-trained vocabulary
it would not have suffered by the problem of domain specific words.

For this experiment the library hyperopt-sklearn \cite{hyperopt} was used, as it accomplishes state-of-the-art AutoML performance.

\subsection{Two Stage Model}
The Two Stage Models is not better than the average baseline. The idea of trying to avoid overfitting by using multiple classifiers for each funniness did not work as expected.

Combining the visual and text information did improve the results, but not significantly. The MAE
score is on par with the baseline, while still beating it at the accuracy score. This improvement is still very weak.
understands humor.

One problem identified was the fact, that the images contained much more data compared to the punchlines. To tackle this problem, the idea was to use a deep autoencoder. This reduces the feature size of the images significantly. But against our expectation it did not improve the results compared to previous attempts.

When comparing the MAE of the Two stage model (figure [\ref{twostagemae}]) an interesting phenomena can be observed: Even though the performance is very similar to the average baseline, the actual MAEs per class are different. This means that the model does not simply return the average funniness, but does something else.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|} 
\hline
\textbf{Funniness} 	& \textbf{1}	& \textbf{2}	& \textbf{3}	& \textbf{4}	& \textbf{5}	& \textbf{6}	& \textbf{7}  \\ 
\hline
Two Stage Model     & 2.42			&  1.57			& 0.97			& 0.8			& 1.53			& 2.28			& 3.64   \\
Baseline Average    & 2.21			& 1.21			& 0.21			& 0.79			& 1.79			& 2.79			& 3.79 \\	
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{MAE per class}
\label{twostagemae}
\end{figure}

A confusion matrix of each classifier in the first stage reveals whether this approach could be effective. If all classifiers have a reasonable accuracy the second decision stage has a higher chance of predicting the correct class. If the first stage only returns noise the second stage would not be able to beat the average baseline.

It seems that the first stage is not effective in doing so. For funniness 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 there is no true negative, which means that the model for this class only learns to always return 1.

\subsection{Autoencoder}

The goal of the auto encoder using the deep convolutional architecture is to reduce the dimensionality of the images, while still maintaining the important characteristics of the original cartoons. 

Comparing the reconstructed cartoon with the original cartoon reveals that the autoencoder looses important semantic information which could be crucial for understanding humor. For example the facial expressions are lost, as well as many other high frequency details. For example the native American lying on the floor is not recognizable anymore. 

These details seem to be very important for the funniness classification task and if missing cause the image data to be not more than additional noise, which is probably the reason why the two stage model with autoencoded cartoons performs worse.

The results at figure [\ref{fig:testperformance}] show the performance of the models for the test set. Compared to the validation set the best performing models change: The model which maximizes the accuracy measure is now using the visual data, namely the transfer learning CNN on the data augmented test set. Also the two stage model without cartoon data seems to generalize slightly better.

\subsection{Training Duration}

Figure [\ref{trainingruntime}] shows the training durations of each experiment. A general trend, is that the text based models (ELMo, Two Stage Model) train significantly faster than the visual based models (Simple CNN, Transfer Learning CNN, Two Stage Model with Cartoons). This can be explained by the size of the input vector for the neural network. The data for the text representation is denser compared to the representation of images.

\chapter {Conclusion}

In general no model really learns to generalize the humor of Gary Larson. There has been no significant improvement compared to the baselines. Further research could reveal significant insights on how human humor works.

Potential causes can not be attributed to exactly one issue. One reason is most certainly, that the problem space is not sufficiently grasped by the dataset. As most deep learning datasets are many order of magnitudes larger, while the task at hand is arguably easier (For example: CIFAR 10 dataset \cite{dogsvscats}) than humor classification. Current techniques of transfer learning are not sufficient to solve this issue. Most certainly once more sophisticated transfer learning techniques have been established, solving this problem could be more feasible. 

One could also argue that the problem itself is flawed. Letting a human rate a
cartoon is very subjective and likely depends on many factors. For example: Current mood, whether the person has already seen the cartoon, time of day and also the exact reason for performing the annotation. It could be that these factors outweigh the true humor, which makes it impossible to reproduce the original ratings. To answer this question an additional experiment could be performed: After some time after the initial ratings were performed, the same person rates the cartoons again. If the ratings are not reproducible by the same annotator, then it seems to be impossible for a deep learning based model.
